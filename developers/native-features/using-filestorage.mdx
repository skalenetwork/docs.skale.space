title: Using Filestorage
description: Use the only native decentralized onchain filestorage
---

SKALE Filestorage is the only onchain and decentralized filestorage in blockchain. The following walks through an example of how to use filestorage on your SKALE Chain.

> Filestorage capacity is dependent on each SKALE Chain. Different size chains and configurations result in different allocations to filestorage, which is a capped resource. Filestorage is ideal for storing static data (i.e one off sets of metadata or images) but not for data that may grow exponentially (i.e user uploads).

## Preparing Files

The following example will be showcasing how to store a static website in filestorage.

## Requirements
You will need:
- An RPC Endpoint
- A private key (with sFUEL) that has been provided with storage space
- Files (see next section)

<Aside type="note">
Storage space must be provided by a SKALE Chain owner. Please contact the SKALE Team in [Discord](https://discord.gg/skale) for support.
</Aside>

## 1. Prepare Files

Anything that builds into HTML, CSS, JS, and media files will work. If you haven't already built a site, you can use the below:

```html:index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>SKALE Filestorage Demo</h1>
        <p>My first decentralized website!</p>
        <a href="https://skale.space" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SKALE Website</a>
    </body>
</html>
```

```css:styles.css
body {
    background-color: #ccc;
}
```

### 2. Upload to your SKALE Chain

Setup your project as follows:
<Aside type="note">
The following assumes you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed on your machine and are using a Unix machine (or command prompt).
</Aside>

Run the following in your terminal:

```shell
mkdir skale-fs-website \
&& cd skale-fs-website \
&& npm init -y \
&& npm install @skalenetwork/filestorage.js dotenv \
&& touch index.js .env \
&& mkdir test-skale \
&& cd test-skale
```

If you are using your own static site, copy the site into the folder called `test-skale`. If you are using the example above,
run the following in your terminal:

```shell
touch index.html styles.css
```

Once complete, copy the above files into their respective files.

### 3. Setup

Open the `index.js` file and copy in the following:

```js:index.js
#! /usr/bin/env node

const Filestorage = require('@skalenetwork/filestorage.js');
const fs = require('fs');
const Web3 = require('web3');
const dotenv = require("dotenv");

dotenv.config();

// If not using the SDK, replace the endpoint below with your SKALE Chain endpoint
let filestorage = new Filestorage('http://localhost:15000');

// If not using the SDK, replace with the SKALE Chain owner key and address.
let privateKey = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY || '<SKALE CHAIN OWNER KEY>';
let address = process.env.ADDRESS || '<SKALE CHAIN OWNER ADDRESS>';

let directoryPath = 'test-skale';

// Bytes of filestorage space to allocate to an address
// reservedSpace must be >= sum of uploaded files
const reservedSpace = 3 * 10 ** 8;

const files = fs.readdirSync(directoryPath);

async function upload() {
    // Owner must reserve space to an address
    await filestorage.reserveSpace(address, address, reservedSpace, privateKey);
    for(let i = 0; i < files.length; ++i)  {
        let content;
        let contentPath;
        content = await fs.readFileSync(directoryPath + '/' + files[i]);
        contentPath = await filestorage.uploadFile(address, files[i], content, privateKey);
    }
}

upload();
```

Open the `.env` file and copy in the following:

```text
PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
RPC_URL=RPC_URL_OF_SKALE_CHAIN
```

### 4. Executing

When executing, this is done via the standard RPC_URL endpoint of your SKALE Chain. This was added to your `.env` file above.
To execute, run the following:

```shell
node index.js
```

Upon executing, [Filestorage.js](https://github.com/skalenetwork/filestorage.js) is taking the files and turning them into EVM chunks which are then sent as transactions
up to the SKALE Chain.

### 6. Access your website

The following is your endpoint:

```shell
# Reverse Proxy Endpoint = mainnet.skalenodes.com
# SKALE Chain Name = honorable-steel-rasalhague
# Filestorage Full Path = uploader address + path + file name + file extension 
# Example: https://network.skalenodes.com/fs/chubby-sadr/77333da3492c4BBB9ccf3Ea5bb63d6202f86cda8/index.html
http(s)://REVERSE_PROXY_ENDPOINT/fs/SKALE_CHAIN_NAME/[FILESTORAGE_FULL_PATH]
```

If connecting directly to a single node on the SKALE Chain, the following is your endpoint:

```shell
# Node Domain Name = validator.com
# SKALE Chain Name = elated-tan-skat
# Filestorage Full Path = uploader address + path + file name + file extension 
# Example: https://node1.validator.com/fluffy-marsupial/77333da3492c4BBB9ccf3Ea5bb63d6202f86cda8/index.html
http(s)://NODE_DOMAIN_NAME/SKALE_CHAIN_NAME/FILESTORAGE_FULL_PATH
```

<Aside type="note">
The uploader address in the URLs MUST omit the 0x prefix AND be in lowercase.
For example: 0x77333Da3492C4BBB9CCF3EA5BB63D6202F86CDA8 must be entered as 77333da3492c4BBB9ccf3Ea5bb63d6202f86cda8

title: SKALE IMA Bridge
description: A native feature of every SKALE Chain enabling fast, secure, and gas-free interoperability across the SKALE Network

## Native - Fast - Gas Free Interoperability - Secure

Every SKALE Chain comes with **built-in bridging and cross-chain messaging**, powered by the Interchain Messaging Agent (IMA). No additional deployment or configuration is required — the bridge is part of the core SKALE architecture.

SKALE Bridge enables:
- **Zero-gas bridging between SKALE Chains**
- **Secure transfers to and from Ethereum**
- **Unified support for ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, and custom contract messaging**
- **Instant transaction finality powered by SKALE’s fast consensus**
- **Full decentralization — no multisigs or centralized operators**

Because the bridge is native, developers can build **true multi-chain dApps** that move tokens, NFTs, and contract calls freely across the network without modifying their existing EVM logic.

> In short: **every SKALE Chain is interoperable by default**, making seamless multi-chain UX a foundational feature of the network.

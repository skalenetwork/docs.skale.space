## Native Features

- **[Bridge](/developers/skale-bridge/overview):** The SKALE Bridge allows for seamless and secure transfers of assets between Ethereum and SKALE as well as SKALE Chain to SKALE Chain. This is a critical feature for any dApp looking to leverage the benefits of both networks,
bring in liquidity, or migrate to SKALE. It's also the fastest decentralized bridge in the space.
- **[Randomness](/developers/random-number-generation):** Secure and decentralized random number generation (RNG) is available on every SKALE Chain. No need to rely on third-party services or oracles any
longer; access RNG (a VRF alternative) directly onchain instantly and for free.
- **[Filestorage](/developers/using-filestorage):** Store files and even websites directly on a SKALE Chain. A great alternative to IPFS and other decentralized storage solutions for static files.

## The Space to Innovate

SKALE is the only decentralized network available that offers developers the space to build without the restirctions of first generation blockchains like Ethereum.
Taking the innovative path, SKALE is not a fork of Ethereum, but a network that was build from the ground up to support the needs of developers building the next generation
of applications and businesses using decentralized technologies.

SKALE enables builders to innovate without limitations blockchains traditional put on both the developers and end-users.

Builders are able to experiment and ship products that:
- Solve real world problems
- Tackle global challenges
- Replace traditional Web2 systems
- Innovate and experiment on the cutting edge of blockchain

With zero gas fees, a sustainable economic model, and industry best speed; SKALE is the ideal place for developers serious about bring the world onchain.

Today, the network is home to over [15 SKALE Chains](https://portal.skale.space/chains), over [100 projects](https://portal.skale.space/ecosystem) who have gone live into production, and over 300 projects actively building on SKALE.
SKALE has become the go-to network for developers building onchain games like [Strayshot](https://www.strayshot.game) and artificial intelligence (AI) based applications like [Exorde](https://exorde.network).

Additionally, SKALE has an actively growing ecosystem of DeFi and financial projects exploring the benefits of zero gas fees and instant finality. Interested in building alongside these world class

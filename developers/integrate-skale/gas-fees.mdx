title: Gas Fees
description: Zero gas fees on SKALE Network
---

SKALE has zero gas fees. Users don't pay for transactions and developers don't need gas tokens to deploy contracts.

## sFUEL

SKALE uses **sFUEL** (SKALE Fuel) as the gas token, but it has no monetary value. It exists for:

1. EVM compatibility with existing tools
2. Preventing spam and DDoS attacks

sFUEL is distributed to users by:
- Chain operators
- dApps
- Public faucets

## Gasless Transactions

SKALE supports gasless transactions that don't require users to have sFUEL:

1. Generate magic number using Proof of Work
2. Set transaction gasPrice to the magic number
3. Execute transaction without sFUEL

The algorithm:
```
X = sha3(address) ⊕ sha3(nonce) ⊕ sha3(gasPrice)
freeGas = (2^256−1) / X / difficulty
```

## Benefits

- **Developers**: Build instantly without buying gas, deploy larger contracts
- **Users**: No gas purchase required, invisible onboarding

<Note>
Use gasless transactions to eliminate operational overhead and increase security.

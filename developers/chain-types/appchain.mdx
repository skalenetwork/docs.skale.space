## What is an Appchain?

An appchain is a dedicated SKALE Chain that is fully dedicated to an individual application or a small subset of applications owned by a company or consortium. Appchains within the SKALE Network can be multiple different sizes and have different configurations.

## Key Characteristics

- **Dedicated Resources**: Each appchain has dedicated compute resources allocated specifically for that application
- **Customizable Configuration**: Appchains can be configured with different sizes, storage allocations, and other parameters
- **Full Control**: Appchain owners have full control over access control, configuration, and chain management
- **Native Features**: All appchains come with native bridge, RNG, filestorage (optional), oracle, and the chain itself

## Gas and Compute Model

Appchains operate with zero gas fees by default, similar to all SKALE Chains. The compute resources are prepaid by the appchain owner through a subscription-based model.

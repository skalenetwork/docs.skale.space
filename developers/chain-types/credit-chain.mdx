## What is a Credit Chain?

A credit chain is a SKALE Chain model that operates on a credit-based system for gas and compute resources. This model allows for more flexible resource allocation and usage tracking.

## Key Characteristics

- **Credit-Based System**: Resources are allocated based on credits rather than traditional gas fees
- **Flexible Usage**: Credits can be managed and distributed according to the chain's needs
- **Usage Tracking**: Detailed tracking of compute and gas resource consumption
- **Prepaid Model**: Credits are typically prepaid by the chain owner or operator

## Gas and Compute Model

Credit chains use a credit system where compute resources are measured in credits. Users or applications consume credits when executing transactions or using compute resources.

## Background

For developers building on SKALE, it is important to understand how a SKALE Chain the permission layer permission layer works for contract deployments and it's impact
on your smart contract architecture. SKALE Chains are Layer 1 blockchains with a number of unique enhancements that give businesses and developers
maximum flexiblity when desigining an application or ecoystem. The permission layer is enabled by default on all SKALE Chains and should be taken into account
when designing smart contracts.

## What is a factory?

A factory is a smart contract that has the ability to deploy another smart contract.
In some cases, this is done in a permissionless way e.g Uniswap where new Uniswap Pools create a new smart contract.
In other cases, this is done in a permissioned way where a project uses a factory to create new versions or releases
but it is locked down to their keys.

## Factory Design Checklist for SKALE

The following are key concepts that should be used when designing factories for SKALE:

- Can this be done WITHOUT a factory. If yes, remove the factory
- Have you disabled generic deployment of the factory (i.e removing CREATE2)
- Have you disabled public deployment of clones (i.e using AccessControl)
- Do you have an explicit list of WHO should be able to deploy through the factory

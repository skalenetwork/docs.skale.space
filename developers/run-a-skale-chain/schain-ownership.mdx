The following is background information on how to operate your SKALE Chain using [multisigwallet-cli](/developers/run-a-skale-chain/using-multisig-wallet-cli).

## SKALE Chain Ownership Structure

By default, on all SKALE V2 Chains; the SKALE Chain ownership structure is a unique combination of predeployed smart contracts, multisignature wallets (across multiple networks), and cold wallets. The structure looks like the following:

-- Ownership Structure Text, Replace with Diagram
There is a smart contract predeployed on every SKALE Chain that is created called **Marionette**. Marionettee is essentially a simple smart contract that has proxied access control and is by default given `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` on other predeployed smart contracts on the SKALE Chain like Etherbase, Filestorage, Config Controller, etc.

Marionette has a role called `PUPPETTEER_ROLE` which allows others to execute dynamic smart contract calls through it. By default, when the chain is created there are two addresses given `PUPPETTEER_ROLE`:

1. The local multisignature wallet deployed on the SKALE Chain which is also a predeployed smart contract
2. The external Gnosis SAFE smart contract address deployed on Ethereum Mainnet which is generally considered to be the "SKALE Chain Owner"

Additionally, by default in this setup MessageProxyForSchain is provided with IMA_ROLE and is needed to allow the Gnosis SAFE on Ethereum Mainnet to post data all the way to Marionette.

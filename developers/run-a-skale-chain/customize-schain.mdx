## State Configuration

One of the most important decisions made when creating a new SKALE Chain is where the state is going to be allocated.
There are three areas that node storage is allocatable too:

1. **Consensus Database**: the area of the node responsible for storing block data
2. **Contract Storage**: the area of the node that stores active contract state
3. **Filestorage**: the area of the node responsible for storing files uploaded or replicated via SKALE Filestorage

The following configurations are available:

## Transaction Processing

SKALE Chains have two options when it comes to transaction processing.

- **Standard Processing**: allows for a single transaction per account/wallet per block. Great for chains interested matching Ethereum's transaction processing architecture
- **Multi-transaction Mode (Recommended)**: great for chains catering to high-throughput applications

import sendNumberExample from "./examples/SendNumber.sol?raw";

The following will guide you through an example implementation of using SKALE's Native Messaging Layer to send custom information back and forth between SKALE Chains.
The following implements a bi-directional flow of data to showcase both sending and receiving clearly, however, contracts can easily implement a one-way flow.

## Custom Contract

<Code code={sendNumberExample} lang="solidity" title="SendNumber.sol" />

## Key Notes
- This contract is both a sender and receiver via IMA
- This means it implements both postOutgoingMessage via MessageProxy interface AND postMessage which is the receiving part
- This contract takes two constructor arguments to set the destination (dst) chain and contract which are later used to check and validate messages

<Warning>
Don't forget to register your smart contracts on MessageProxyForSchain next! See [Connect Custom Contracts](/developers/skale-bridge/messaging-layer/connect-custom-contracts) for next steps!

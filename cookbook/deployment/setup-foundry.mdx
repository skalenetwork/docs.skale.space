## Setup Foundry

Foundry is a blazing fast, portable, and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust. This guide will help you set up Foundry for developing on SKALE.

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed on your machine
- Basic command-line knowledge

<Note>
If you are on a Windows machine, you will need to use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), since Foundry doesn't work natively on Windows.
</Note>

## Step 1: Install Foundry

Install Foundry by running:

```shell
foundryup
```

This will install the latest stable release of Foundry, including:
- **Forge**: Build, test, and deploy smart contracts
- **Cast**: Interact with EVM smart contracts, send transactions, and read chain data
- **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node for testing
- **Chisel**: Solidity REPL

## Step 2: Verify Installation

Verify that Foundry is installed correctly:

```shell
forge --version
cast --version
anvil --version
```

You should see version numbers for each tool.

## Step 3: Create a New Foundry Project

Create a new Foundry project:

```shell
forge init my-skale-project
cd my-skale-project
```

This creates a new directory with the following structure:

```
my-skale-project/
├── src/          # Smart contracts
├── script/       # Deployment scripts
├── test/         # Test files
├── lib/          # Dependencies
├── foundry.toml  # Configuration file
└── remappings.txt # Import remappings
```

## Step 4: Configure Foundry for SKALE

Update the `foundry.toml` file to add SKALE Chain endpoints:

```toml
[profile.default]
src = "src"
out = "out"
libs = ["lib"]

# SKALE Chain Configuration
[rpc_endpoints]
skale_testnet = "https://testnet.skalenodes.com/v1/juicy-low-small-testnet"
skale_mainnet = "https://mainnet.skalenodes.com/v1/elated-tan-skat"
# Add your custom SKALE Chain endpoint here

[etherscan]
skale_testnet = { key = "", url = "https://juicy-low-small-testnet.explorer.testnet.skalenodes.com/api" }
```

<Note>
Replace the RPC URLs with your specific SKALE Chain endpoint. You can find SKALE Chain endpoints in the [SKALE Portal](https://portal.skale.space).
</Note>

## Step 5: Install Dependencies

Install OpenZeppelin Contracts (or other dependencies):

```shell
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
```

This will add the dependency to your `lib` directory.

## Step 6: Configure Remappings

Update your `remappings.txt` file to include:

```
@openzeppelin/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/
```

## Step 7: Create a Keystore (Optional but Recommended)

For secure deployment, create a Foundry keystore:

```shell
cast wallet import skale-deployer --private-key $(cast wallet new | grep 'Private key:' | awk '{print $3}')
```

<Note>
Provide a password to encrypt the keystore file. If you forget this password, you will not be able to recover it.
</Note>

Get your wallet address:

```shell
cast wallet address --account skale-deployer
```

Copy this address and fund it with sFUEL from the [sFUEL Station](https://sfuelstation).

## Step 8: Test Your Setup

Compile your contracts:

```shell
forge build
```

Run tests:

```shell
forge test
```

## SKALE-Specific Considerations

When deploying to SKALE, remember to:

1. **Use the `--legacy` flag**: SKALE Chains require legacy transaction format
   ```shell
   forge create src/MyContract.sol:MyContract \
       --account skale-deployer \
       --rpc-url skale_testnet \
       --broadcast \
       --legacy
   ```

2. **Use `--slow` flag for scripts**: When running scripts with multiple transactions
   ```shell
   forge script script/Deploy.s.sol \
       --account skale-deployer \
       --rpc-url skale_testnet \
       --broadcast \
       --slow \
       --legacy
   ```

3. **Verify contracts**: Use the block explorer API for verification
   ```shell
   forge verify-contract \
       --rpc-url skale_testnet \
       <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> \
       src/MyContract.sol:MyContract \
       --verifier blockscout \
       --verifier-url https://juicy-low-small-testnet.explorer.testnet.skalenodes.com/api
   ```

## Next Steps

Now that Foundry is set up, you can:

- [Deploy an ERC-20 Token](/cookbook/smart-contracts/deploy-erc20-token)
- [Deploy an ERC-721 Token](/cookbook/smart-contracts/deploy-erc721-token)
- [Deploy an ERC-1155 Token](/cookbook/smart-contracts/deploy-erc1155-token)
- [Solidity Quickstart](/developers/solidity-quickstart)

## Deploy a Website on SKALE Filestorage

Follow these steps to deploy a decentralized website using SKALE Filestorage and the built-in Web3 server.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- A SKALE Chain endpoint (you can use any SKALE Chain)
- SKALE Chain owner private key or deployment-authorized private key
- Basic knowledge of static website development

<Note>
You will need to have the owner private key or a deployment-authorized private key to permissively upload files.
</Note>

## Step 1: Get a SKALE Chain Endpoint

The following will work with any SKALE Chain. You can use the [Chaos Testnet Chain](/get-started/chain-info) or any other SKALE chain you have access to.

## Step 2: Prepare Your Files

Assuming you already have built a statically generated website (if not, check out [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), or others - see a list at [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/generators/)). 

If you haven't already built a site, here is a simple code example that you can copy and paste:

**Save this as `index.html`:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>SKALE-ING</h1>
        <p>My first decentralized website.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

**Save this as `styles.css`:**

```css
body {
    background-color: #ccc;
}
```

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

Create a new directory for your project and install the required dependencies:

```shell
npm install @skalenetwork/filestorage.js dotenv
```

## Step 4: Upload to Your SKALE Chain

Assuming the `index.html` and `styles.css`, or static site files are stored in a folder called `test-skale`, create a script file with the following code:

**Save this as `filestorageUpload.js`:**

```javascript
#! /usr/bin/env node

const Filestorage = require('@skalenetwork/filestorage.js');
const fs = require('fs');
const Web3 = require('web3');
const dotenv = require("dotenv");

dotenv.config();

// Replace the endpoint below with your SKALE Chain endpoint
let filestorage = new Filestorage('http://localhost:15000'); 

// Replace with the SKALE Chain owner key and address.
let privateKey = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY || '<SKALE CHAIN OWNER KEY>';
let address = process.env.ADDRESS || '<SKALE CHAIN OWNER ADDRESS>';

let directoryPath = 'test-skale';

// Bytes of filestorage space to allocate to an address
// reservedSpace must be >= sum of uploaded files
const reservedSpace = 3 * 10 ** 8;

const files = fs.readdirSync(directoryPath);

async function upload() {
    // Owner must reserve space to an address
    await filestorage.reserveSpace(address, address, reservedSpace, privateKey);
    for(let i = 0; i < files.length; ++i)  {
        let content;
        let contentPath;
        content = await fs.readFileSync(directoryPath + '/' + files[i]);
        contentPath = await filestorage.uploadFile(address, files[i], content, privateKey);
    }
}

upload();
```

<Note>
When executing, your files are sent to the SKALE Chain endpoint, routed to one of the 16 nodes supporting your chain, and fed into the EVM in chunks, with a specific header to indicate these EVM messages are for filestorage. These messages are broadcast to the other 15 nodes to reach state consensus. On each of these nodes, a specific predeployed contract called Filestorage will process these chunks and store them into specific partitions. This way your files are replicated across 16 nodes, and served using an nginx container on each of the nodes.
</Note>

## Step 5: Execute the Script

Be sure to add execution permissions and then run the script:

```shell
chmod +x filestorageUpload.js
./filestorageUpload.js
```

## Step 6: Access Your Website

If you are using the SDK, just head over to `http://localhost/fs/<ACCOUNT>/<FILENAME>`, or if using the above example, `http://localhost/fs/<ACCOUNT>/index.html` to see your SKALE Chain hosted index.html file. This is served by the nginx containers hosted on the nodes of your SKALE Chain.

Be sure to replace the `<ACCOUNT>` with the non-0x prefixed address of the account that performed the upload. For example, if `0xA23451234512345123451234512345123451234b` performed the upload, then enter `http://localhost/fs/a23451234512345123451234512345123451234b/index.html`.

<Note>
The address in URL must be in lowercase.

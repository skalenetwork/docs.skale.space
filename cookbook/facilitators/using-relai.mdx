description: "Integrate RelAI facilitator for x402 payment processing"
---

RelAI is a hosted facilitator service that simplifies x402 payment processing on SKALE Network. Instead of running your own facilitator infrastructure, you can use RelAI's SDK to handle payment verification and settlement across multiple tokens.

## Highlights

The RelAI facilitator has **enabled BITE transactions** for both **SKALE Base** and **SKALE Base Sepolia**.

**What does this mean?** 
- When a merchant settles any x402 transaction through RelAI facilitator it gets automatically encrypted through BITE and only decrypted at the consensus level

For more inforamtion around BITE please check [here](concepts/bite-protocol/intro-bite-protocol).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- A wallet on SKALE Base or SKALE Base Sepolia
- Basic understanding of x402 protocol

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with RelAI configuration:

```bash
# Your wallet address to receive payments
PAYMENT_RECEIVER_ADDRESS=0xYourWalletAddressHere

# Private key for client (NEVER commit this!)
PRIVATE_KEY=0xYourPrivateKeyHere

# Server port
PORT=3000

# Price for premium endpoint (in USD)
PREMIUM_PRICE=0.01
```

### Supported Networks and Tokens

RelAI supports the following SKALE networks:

| Network | Tokens |
|---------|--------|
| SKALE Base Sepolia | USDC, USDT, ETH, SKL, WBTC |
| SKALE Base| USDC, USDT, ETH, SKL, WBTC |

## Integration with RelAI

Make sure to install the RelAI SDK:
```sh
 npm install @relai-fi/x402
```

    ```typescript
    import express from 'express';
    import cors from 'cors';
    import dotenv from 'dotenv';
    import Relai from '@relai-fi/x402/server';

    dotenv.config();

    const app = express();
    const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

    // Middleware
    app.use(cors());
    app.use(express.json());

    // Initialize RelAI SDK for SKALE Base Sepolia
    const relai = new Relai({
      network: 'skale-base-sepolia',
      facilitatorUrl: 'https://facilitator.x402.fi'
    });

    // Public endpoint - no payment required
    app.get('/api/public', (req, res) => {
      res.json({
        message: 'This is a public endpoint - no payment required',
        network: 'SKALE Base Sepolia'
      });

    // Premium endpoint - protected by x402 payment
    app.get(
      '/api/premium',
      relai.protect({
        payTo: process.env.PAYMENT_RECEIVER_ADDRESS!,
        price: parseFloat(process.env.PREMIUM_PRICE || '0.01'),
      }),
      (req, res) => {
        // Payment is automatically verified by the middleware
        // req.payment contains the payment details
        res.json({
          success: true,
          message: 'Premium data unlocked via RelAI!',
          payment: req.payment
        });
      }
    );

    // Start server
    app.listen(PORT, () => {
      console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
    });
    ```

  <Tab title="Client Setup">

    ```typescript
    import dotenv from 'dotenv';
    import { createX402Client } from '@relai-fi/x402/client';
    import { privateKeyToAccount } from 'viem/accounts';

    dotenv.config();

    async function main() {
      const SERVER_URL = process.env.SERVER_URL || 'http://localhost:3000';

      // Create account from private key
      const privateKey = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as `0x${string}`;
      const account = privateKeyToAccount(privateKey);

      // Create x402 client with RelAI
      const client = createX402Client({
        wallets: {
          evm: {
            address: account.address,
            signTypedData: (params) =>
              account.signTypedData(params as any),
          },
        },
      });

      // Access RelAI-protected resource
      const response = await client.fetch(`${SERVER_URL}/api/premium`);

      if (response.ok) {
        const data = await response.json();
        console.log('Data received:', data);
      }
    }

    main().catch(console.error);
    ```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

If you cannot connect to RelAI:

1. Verify the facilitator URL is correct
2. Check network connectivity
3. Ensure your wallet has tokens for gas fees
4. Review firewall settings

### Payment Failures

Common causes and solutions:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Invalid signature | Verify wallet configuration and signing |
| Insufficient balance | Ensure payer has enough tokens |
| Network mismatch | Check network matches configuration |
| Invalid receiver | Verify PAYMENT_RECEIVER_ADDRESS is correct |

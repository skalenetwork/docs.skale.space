[Kobaru](https://www.kobaru.io) is the payment infrastructure built from scratch by payment veterans who understand what production systems demand. This is not a wrapper around existing payment rails or a quick adaptation of traditional processors. Kobaru is a purpose-built payment engine designed for developers who need institutional-grade reliability, complete visibility into their revenue operations, and the freedom to focus on building their business instead of managing payment complexity. Whether you are an Enterprise or Independent Developer, Kobaru has the right features for you.

Your API becomes payable by machines—AI agents, automated scripts, and developer tools pay fractions of a cent per request with instant settlement and zero gas fees. Kobaru handles all the complexity: cryptography, blockchain interactions, settlement verification, and reconciliation. You focus on your business logic.


## Why SKALE Base with Kobaru?

**Start instantly, no barriers.** Point your SDK to `https://gateway.kobaru.io` and start accepting payments with SKALE. No sign-up required, no API keys, no approval process. Advanced features (Console, enhanced SLAs, professional support) available when you want them.

**Instant settlement.** SKALE's instant finality—faster than any other network. Your customers get immediate access, you get immediate revenue.

**Zero gas fees.** Kobaru pays all gas fees on SKALE Base. Your users pay only the exact service amount—no hidden costs, no fee surprises, no variable unit economics.

**Predictable costs.** No gas price spikes or unexpected fees. Perfect for high-volume APIs processing thousands of micropayments daily.

**Zero payment complexity for you.** [Kobaru](https://www.kobaru.io) handles cryptographic signatures, blockchain interactions, settlement verification and financial reconciliation. Your engineering team builds product features, not payment infrastructure.

**Native Base bridge.** Seamless USDC transfers between Base and SKALE using SKALE's built-in bridge—no third-party risk, no additional trust assumptions.

**Fiat Settlement.** Kobaru focuses on abstracting payment complexities and will soon introduce Fiat Settlement options for users looking to leverage SKALE's performance without any blockchain-related friction. Stay updated on [Kobaru's blog](https://blog.kobaru.io).

**Institutional-grade infrastructure.** [Kobaru's production platform](https://www.kobaru.io) provides real-time analytics, professional reconciliation, comprehensive audit trails, and 24/7 enterprise support with SLA guarantees.

## Prerequisites

- A EVM wallet address (to receive USDC payments)
- An API you want to monetize
- Basic understanding of x402 protocol (optional, [Kobaru documentation](https://docs.kobaru.io) covers all integration details)

---

## Quick start: production-ready monetization in seconds

The Transparent Proxy transforms any existing API into a monetized endpoint without modifying your backend. No code changes. No deployment cycles. No infrastructure modifications.

This is not just "zero code"—this is production-ready monetization that works with your existing infrastructure exactly as it runs today.

### Step 1: create your Kobaru account

1. Go to [console.kobaru.io](https://console.kobaru.io)
2. Sign up with your email

### Step 2: register your API

In the Kobaru Console:

1. Click **New Service**
2. Configure your service:
   - **Service name**: Descriptive name (e.g., `skale-data-api`)
   - **Backend URL**: Your API's base URL (e.g., `https://api.yourcompany.com`)
   - **Slug**: Unique identifier for proxy URL (e.g., `skale-data`)
3. Define your first paid route:
   - **Route pattern**: Endpoint path (e.g., `/premium-data`)
   - **Price**: Cost per request in USD (e.g., `$0.001`)
   - **Network**: Select **SKALE Base** (Mainnet or Sepolia)
   - **Usage model**: `pay_per_request` or `pay_per_time`

### Step 3: go live immediately

Your API is now accessible at:

```
https://access.kobaru.io/{your-slug}/premium-data
```

**That's it.** Your API is monetized. Kobaru automatically:

- Returns HTTP 402 with payment requirements to unpaid requests
- Verifies payments on SKALE Base with cryptographic proof
- Forwards authenticated requests to your backend
- Settles payments to your wallet in ~1 second
- Logs every transaction for reconciliation

Your backend remains untouched. Your deployment pipeline unchanged. Your existing customers unaffected on non-monetized routes.

## SDK integration: 100% x402 compatible

Kobaru is fully compatible with the official x402 SDK, supporting TypeScript/Node.js, Go, and Python. You can use the standard x402 libraries with Kobaru as your facilitator—no custom code or proprietary SDKs required.

### Official x402 SDK support

**Languages supported:**
- **TypeScript/Node.js** - Full middleware support for Hono and Express
- **Go** - Integration for Go backends with Gin
- **Python** - Flask and FastAPI compatibility

**Key advantage:** Use the same SDK code across any x402-compatible facilitator. Kobaru implements the complete x402 v2 specification, ensuring your integration works exactly as documented.

### Quick start example

Here's a minimal example to accept SKALE payments with Kobaru using Hono:

```typescript
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { serve } from "@hono/node-server";
import { cors } from "hono/cors";
import { paymentMiddleware, x402ResourceServer } from "@x402/hono";
import { ExactEvmScheme } from "@x402/evm/exact/server";
import { HTTPFacilitatorClient } from "@x402/core/server";
import "dotenv/config";

const app = new Hono();
app.use("*", cors());

async function main() {
  // Configure Kobaru facilitator
  const facilitatorUrl = process.env.FACILITATOR_URL || "https://gateway.kobaru.io";
  const facilitatorClient = new HTTPFacilitatorClient({
    url: facilitatorUrl,
    ...(process.env.KOBARU_API_KEY && {
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.KOBARU_API_KEY}` }
    })
  });

  // Register EVM payment scheme for SKALE
  const resourceServer = new x402ResourceServer(facilitatorClient);
  resourceServer.register("eip155:*", new ExactEvmScheme());

  // Fetch token metadata from Kobaru instead of hardcoding
  const networkId = "eip155:1187947933"; // SKALE Base Mainnet
  const assetAddress = "0x85889c8c714505E0c94b8b30fcfcF64fE3Ac8FCb20"; // USDC on SKALE Base

  const supported = await facilitatorClient.getSupported();
  const networkData = supported.kinds?.find(
    (kind: any) => kind.network === networkId &&
    kind.extra?.asset?.toLowerCase() === assetAddress.toLowerCase()
  );

  const { name, version, decimals } = networkData?.extra ? {
    name: networkData.extra.name as string,
    version: networkData.extra.version as string,
    decimals: networkData.extra.decimals as number
  } : {
    name: "USDC",
    version: "1",
    decimals: 6
  };

  // Define payment requirements
  const routes = {
    "GET /api/data": {
      accepts: [
        {
          scheme: "exact",
          network: networkId,
          payTo: process.env.WALLET_ADDRESS as `0x${string}`,
          price: {
            amount: "1000", // 0.001 USDC
            asset: assetAddress,
            extra: { name, version }
          }
        }
      ],
      description: "Premium data access",
      mimeType: "application/json"
    }
  };

  // Apply payment middleware
  app.use("*", paymentMiddleware(routes, resourceServer));

  // Protected endpoint
  app.get("/api/data", (c) => {
    return c.json({
      message: "Premium data unlocked!",
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });
  });

  const port = Number(process.env.PORT) || 3000;
  serve({ fetch: app.fetch, port }, () => {
    console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${port}`);
    console.log(`Using Kobaru facilitator: ${facilitatorUrl}`);
  });
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

**Environment variables:**

```bash
# Required: Your wallet to receive payments
WALLET_ADDRESS=0xYourWalletAddress

# Optional: Kobaru facilitator URL (defaults to https://gateway.kobaru.io)
FACILITATOR_URL=https://gateway.kobaru.io

# Optional: Kobaru API key for enhanced features
KOBARU_API_KEY=your_api_key_from_console

# Optional: Server port
PORT=3000
```

### Instant integration: no sign-up required

If you already have a working application with x402 v2 SDK, start processing payments immediately by pointing your application to Kobaru's URL:

```typescript
const facilitator = new HTTPFacilitatorClient({
  url: "https://gateway.kobaru.io"
});
```

**That's it.** Your application starts accepting payments instantly.

## Troubleshooting

Kobaru provides detailed error messages and the Console shows real-time diagnostics. For common issues:

### Payment verification fails

**Common causes:**

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Invalid API key | Verify `KOBARU_API_KEY` in console.kobaru.io |
| Wrong network | Ensure application uses `eip155:1187947933` (mainnet) or `eip155:324705682` (testnet) |
| Insufficient balance | User needs USDC on SKALE Base (bridge from Base) |
| Expired signature | Client must sign fresh payment (check `maxTimeoutSeconds`) |
| Wrong token address | Use `0x85889c8c714505E0c94b30fcfcF64fE3Ac8FCb20` (mainnet) or `0x2e08028E3C4c2356572E096d8EF835cD5C6030bD` (testnet) |

### Viem token metadata issues

If using Viem with Node.js, token name fetching may fail. **Solution**: Fetch metadata from Kobaru's `/supported` endpoint instead of hardcoding:

```typescript
// Fetch from Kobaru instead of hardcoding
const supported = await facilitatorClient.getSupported();
const networkData = supported.kinds?.find(
  (kind: any) => kind.network === networkId &&
  kind.extra?.asset?.toLowerCase() === assetAddress.toLowerCase()
  );
if (networkData?.extra) {
	const { name, version, decimals } = networkData.extra;
	return {
		name: (name as string),
		version: (version as string),
		decimals: (decimals as number)
	};
}
```

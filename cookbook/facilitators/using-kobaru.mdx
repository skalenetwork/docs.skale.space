[Kobaru](https://www.kobaru.io) enables machine-to-machine payments, allowing AI agents and automated systems to pay per request. With payment infrastructure built for developers they aim to deliver reliable, transparent payments without operational overhead.

## Kobaru Products

- **Kobaru Console**: A central revenue command center that allows users to manage payment infrastructure, track real-time analytics, and perform professional financial reconciliation without writing code.

- **Transparent Proxy**: A no-code monetization tool that transforms any existing API into a paid endpoint by wrapping it in a payment layer without requiring changes to the original backend.

- **Kobaru Gateway**: The core facilitator infrastructure that handles cryptographic signatures and verifies instant settlements on the SKALE network for incoming payment requests.

- **API Paywall Cookbook**: An open-source repository of production-ready templates and examples that help developers implement various monetization patterns across multiple programming languages.

## Why SKALE Base with Kobaru?

Kobaru makes it easy to get started with x402 payments on SKALE. Just hook right up to the gateway with your existing SDK -- setting Kobaru as the facilitator -- and you can start accepting payments on SKALE.

**x402 Facilitator** Point your SDK to `https://gateway.kobaru.io` and start accepting payments with SKALE.

**Instant settlement.** SKALE's instant finality—faster than any other network. Your customers get immediate access, you get immediate revenue.

**Predictable costs.** No gas price spikes or unexpected fees. Perfect for high-volume APIs processing thousands of micropayments daily.

**Fiat Settlement.** Kobaru focuses on abstracting payment complexities and will soon introduce Fiat Settlement options for users looking to leverage SKALE's performance without any blockchain-related friction.

## Prerequisites

- A EVM wallet address - to receive USDC payments
- An API you want to monetize
- Basic understanding of x402 protocol. To learn more about it check [here](/get-started/agentic-builders/start-with-x402).

## Instant API Monetization

**Transparent Proxy**, a Kobaru product, transforms any existing API into a monetized endpoint without modifying your backend. No code changes. No deployment cycles. No infrastructure modifications.

This is not just "zero code"—this is production-ready monetization that works with your existing infrastructure exactly as it runs today.

### Step 1: Create Your Kobaru Account

1. Go to [console.kobaru.io](https://console.kobaru.io)
2. Sign up with your email

### Step 2: Register Your API

In the Kobaru Console:

1. Click **New Service**
2. Configure your service:
   - **Service name**: Descriptive name (e.g., `skale-data-api`)
   - **Backend URL**: Your API's base URL (e.g., `https://api.yourcompany.com`)
   - **Slug**: Unique identifier for proxy URL (e.g., `skale-data`)
3. Define your first paid route:
   - **Route pattern**: Endpoint path (e.g., `/premium-data`)
   - **Price**: Cost per request in USD (e.g., `$0.001`)
   - **Network**: Select **SKALE Base** (Mainnet or Sepolia)
   - **Usage model**: `pay_per_request` or `pay_per_time`

### Step 3: Go Live and Get Paid

Your API is now accessible at:

```
https://access.kobaru.io/{your-slug}/premium-data
```

**That's it.** Your API is now x402-compatible an able to be paid for by both humans and agents using x402. Kobaru automatically:

- Returns an HTTP 402 response with payment requirements on unpaid requests
- Verifies payments on SKALE Base with cryptographic proof
- Forwards authenticated requests to your backend
- Settles payments to your wallet in ~1 second
- Logs every transaction for reconciliation

## x402 SDK

### Official support

**Languages supported:**
- **TypeScript/Node.js** - Full middleware support for Hono and Express
- **Go** - Integration for Go backends with Gin
- **Python** - Flask and FastAPI compatibility

**Key advantage:** Use the same SDK code across any x402-compatible facilitator. Kobaru implements the complete x402 v2 specification, ensuring your integration works exactly as documented.

### Integration

Environment variables:

```bash
# Required: Your wallet to receive payments
WALLET_ADDRESS=0xYourWalletAddress

# Optional: Kobaru API key for enhanced features
KOBARU_API_KEY=your_api_key_from_console
```

## Kobaru Console

The Kobaru Console is not just a dashboard—it is a complete revenue command center that gives you operational control over your entire payment infrastructure.

**Create a free account** to unlock Console access with enhanced features:
- **Real-time analytics** - Live transaction feed, revenue tracking, settlement confirmation
- **Failure diagnostics** - Identify and resolve payment issues before they impact customers
- **Professional reconciliation** - Complete audit trails and exportable reports for compliance
- **Manage your payment infrastructure without touching code** - Adjust pricing, endpoints, and rate limits instantly
- **Improved performance** - Priority routing and enhanced uptime guarantees
- **Enterprise support** - 24/7 diagnostics with guaranteed response times

**Using Console with the SDK:**

When you have an API key from [console.kobaru.io](https://console.kobaru.io), include it for enhanced service:

```typescript
const facilitator = new HTTPFacilitatorClient({
  url: "https://gateway.kobaru.io",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": `Bearer ${process.env.KOBARU_API_KEY}`
  }
});
```

## Troubleshooting

Kobaru provides detailed error messages and the Console shows real-time diagnostics. For common issues:

### Payment verification fails

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Invalid API key | Verify `KOBARU_API_KEY` in console.kobaru.io |
| Wrong network | Ensure application uses `eip155:1187947933` (mainnet) or `eip155:324705682` (testnet) |
| Insufficient balance | User needs USDC on SKALE Base (bridge from Base) |
| Expired signature | Client must sign fresh payment (check `maxTimeoutSeconds`) |
| Wrong token address | Use `0x85889c8c714505E0c94b30fcfcF64fE3Ac8FCb20` (mainnet) or `0x2e08028E3C4c2356572E096d8EF835cD5C6030bD` (testnet) |

### Viem token metadata issues

If using Viem with Node.js, token name fetching may fail. **Solution**: Fetch metadata from Kobaru's `/supported` endpoint instead of hardcoding:

```typescript
// Fetch from Kobaru instead of hardcoding
const supported = await facilitatorClient.getSupported();
const networkData = supported.kinds?.find(
  (kind: any) => kind.network === networkId &&
  kind.extra?.asset?.toLowerCase() === assetAddress.toLowerCase()
  );
if (networkData?.extra) {
	const { name, version, decimals } = networkData.extra;
	return {
		name: (name as string),
		version: (version as string),
		decimals: (decimals as number)
	};
}
```

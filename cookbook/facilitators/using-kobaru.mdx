---

[Kobaru](https://www.kobaru.io) is the payment infrastructure built from scratch by payment veterans who understand what production systems demand. This is not a wrapper around existing payment rails or a quick adaptation of traditional processors. Kobaru is a purpose-built payment engine designed for developers who need institutional-grade reliability, complete visibility into their revenue operations, and the freedom to focus on building their business instead of managing payment complexity. Whether you are an Enterprise or Independent Developer, Kobaru has the right features for you.

Your API becomes payable by machines—AI agents, automated scripts, and developer tools pay fractions of a cent per request with instant settlement and zero gas fees. Kobaru handles all the complexity: cryptography, blockchain interactions, settlement verification, and reconciliation. You focus on your business logic.

## Why Kobaru stands out

Kobaru is the only facilitator purpose-built for production workloads that demand institutional-grade reliability. Payment veterans designed every component—from the settlement engine to the reconciliation pipeline—for companies that cannot tolerate payment failures.

### Built for production, not prototypes

### The Kobaru difference

**Start instantly, no barriers.** Point your SDK to `https://gateway.kobaru.io` and start accepting payments. No sign-up required, no API keys, no approval process. Advanced features (Console, enhanced SLAs, professional support) available for free when you want them.

**Institutional-grade reliability.** Kobaru is the only facilitator with enterprise-grade uptime guarantees, comprehensive monitoring, and reconciliation built for companies where payment failures mean lost revenue and damaged customer relationships.

**Zero payment complexity for you.** Kobaru handles cryptographic signatures, blockchain interactions, settlement verification, refund processing, and financial reconciliation. Your engineering team builds product features, not payment infrastructure.

**Funds settle to your wallet.** No intermediary custody. No waiting periods. Payments settle directly to your wallet in no time.

**Fiat Settlement.** Kobaru focuses on abstracting payment complexities and will soon introduce Fiat Settlement options for users looking to leverage SKALE’s performance without any blockchain-related friction.

## Kobaru Console: your revenue command center

The Kobaru Console is not just a dashboard—it is a complete revenue command center that gives you operational control over your entire payment infrastructure.

### Real-time revenue visibility

Monitor your payment operations with metrics that matter:

- **Live transaction feed**: Watch payments settle in real-time across all your services
- **Revenue analytics**: Track daily, weekly, and monthly revenue by endpoint, service, or customer
- **Settlement confirmation**: Verify every payment with on-chain transaction links
- **Failure diagnostics**: Identify and resolve payment issues before they impact customers

### Professional reconciliation

Enterprise finance teams require audit-ready records. Kobaru delivers:

- **Complete audit trails**: Every transaction logged with timestamps, amounts, payers, and settlement proofs
- **Exportable reports**: Download reconciliation data in formats your accounting systems accept
- **Historical analysis**: Query transaction history for compliance, disputes, or financial planning
- **Multi-service aggregation**: Consolidated reporting across all your monetized endpoints

### Operational control

Manage your payment infrastructure without touching code:

- **Service management**: Add, modify, or disable paid endpoints instantly
- **Pricing controls**: Adjust per-request pricing in real-time
- **Rate limiting**: Protect your infrastructure with configurable request limits

## Prerequisites

- A EVM wallet address (to receive USDC payments)
- An API you want to monetize
- Basic understanding of x402 protocol (optional, since Kobaru handles the complexity)

---

## Quick start: production-ready monetization in secods

The Transparent Proxy transforms any existing API into a monetized endpoint without modifying your backend. No code changes. No deployment cycles. No infrastructure modifications.

This is not just "zero code"—this is production-ready monetization that works with your existing infrastructure exactly as it runs today.

### Step 1: create your Kobaru account

1. Go to [console.kobaru.io](https://console.kobaru.io)
2. Sign up with your email
3. Connect your EVM wallet (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, etc.)

### Step 2: register your API

In the Kobaru Console:

1. Click **New Service**
2. Configure your service:
   - **Service name**: Descriptive name (e.g., `skale-data-api`)
   - **Backend URL**: Your API's base URL (e.g., `https://api.yourcompany.com`)
   - **Slug**: Unique identifier for proxy URL (e.g., `skale-data`)
3. Define your first paid route:
   - **Route pattern**: Endpoint path (e.g., `/premium-data`)
   - **Price**: Cost per request in USD (e.g., `$0.001`)
   - **Network**: Select **SKALE Base** (Mainnet or Sepolia)
   - **Usage model**: `pay_per_request` or `pay_per_time`

### Step 3: go live immediately

Your API is now accessible at:

```
https://access.kobaru.io/{your-slug}/premium-data
```

**That's it.** Your API is monetized. Kobaru automatically:

- Returns HTTP 402 with payment requirements to unpaid requests
- Verifies payments on SKALE Base with cryptographic proof
- Forwards authenticated requests to your backend
- Settles payments to your wallet in ~1 second
- Logs every transaction for reconciliation

Your backend remains untouched. Your deployment pipeline unchanged. Your existing customers unaffected on non-monetized routes.

## Production checklist

Before going live on SKALE Base Mainnet:

- [ ] Set appropriate pricing (remember: $0.001 = 1000 atomic units)
- [ ] Add health check endpoints (exclude from payment requirements)
- [ ] Document your API pricing for consumers
- [ ] Ensure error handling for network timeouts
- [ ] Test full payment flow on SKALE Base Sepolia testnet
- [ ] Verify payments settle to your wallet address
- [ ] Switch to mainnet configuration (`NETWORK_CHAIN_ID=1187947933`)
- [ ] Review reconciliation reports in Console

---

## Troubleshooting

Kobaru provides detailed error messages and the Console shows real-time diagnostics. For common issues:

### Payment verification fails

**Common causes:**

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Invalid API key | Verify `KOBARU_API_KEY` in console.kobaru.io |
| Wrong network | Ensure application uses `eip155:1187947933` (mainnet) or `eip155:324705682` (testnet) |
| Insufficient balance | User needs USDC on SKALE Base (bridge from Base) |
| Expired signature | Client must sign fresh payment (check `maxTimeoutSeconds`) |
| Wrong token address | Use `0x85889c8c714505E0c94b30fcfcF64fE3Ac8FCb20` (mainnet) or `0x2e08028E3C4c2356572E096d8EF835cD5C6030bD` (testnet) |

### Viem token metadata issues

If using Viem with Node.js, token name fetching may fail. **Solution**: Fetch metadata from Kobaru's `/supported` endpoint instead of hardcoding:

```typescript
// Fetch from Kobaru instead of hardcoding
const supported = await facilitatorClient.getSupported();
const networkData = supported.kinds?.find(
  (kind: any) => kind.network === networkId &&
  kind.extra?.asset?.toLowerCase() === assetAddress.toLowerCase()
  );
if (networkData?.extra) {
	const { name, version, decimals } = networkData.extra;
	return {
		name: (name as string),
		version: (version as string),
		decimals: (decimals as number)
	};
}
```

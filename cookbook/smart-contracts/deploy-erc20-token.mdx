## Deploy an ERC-20 Token

This tutorial will walk you through deploying an ERC-20 token on SKALE using Foundry and OpenZeppelin Contracts. OpenZeppelin provides secure, community-vetted smart contract templates that follow best practices.

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed on your machine
- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh) installed
- A wallet with sFUEL
- Basic knowledge of Solidity
- A SKALE Chain endpoint

<Note>
If you are on a Windows machine, you will need to use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), since Foundry doesn't work natively on Windows.
</Note>

## Step 1: Install Foundry

If you haven't already installed Foundry, run:

```shell
foundryup
```

## Step 2: Create a New Foundry Project

Run the following in your terminal:

```shell
forge init my-erc20-token
cd my-erc20-token
```

## Step 3: Install OpenZeppelin Contracts

Install OpenZeppelin Contracts using Foundry:

```shell
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
```

This will add OpenZeppelin Contracts to your `lib` directory.

## Step 4: Configure Remappings

Update your `remappings.txt` file (or create it if it doesn't exist) to include:

```
@openzeppelin/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/
```

## Step 5: Update Foundry Configuration

Update the `foundry.toml` file to add your SKALE Chain endpoint:

```toml
[profile.default]
src = "src"
out = "out"
libs = ["lib"]

# SKALE Chain Configuration
[rpc_endpoints]
skale_testnet = "https://testnet.skalenodes.com/v1/juicy-low-small-testnet"
# Replace with your SKALE Chain endpoint
```

## Step 6: Create the ERC-20 Contract

Create a new file `src/MyERC20.sol`:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract MyERC20 is ERC20 {
    constructor() ERC20("MyToken", "MTK") {
        // Mint 1 million tokens to the deployer (18 decimals)
        _mint(msg.sender, 1000000 * 10 ** decimals());
    }
}
```

This contract:
- Inherits from OpenZeppelin's `ERC20` contract
- Sets the token name to "MyToken" and symbol to "MTK"
- Mints 1,000,000 tokens to the deployer address upon deployment

## Step 7: Compile the Contract

Compile your contract:

```shell
forge build
```

## Step 8: Prepare Signer for Deployment

This tutorial uses the Foundry Keystore for increased security. Create a new keystore:

```shell
cast wallet import skale-deployer --private-key $(cast wallet new | grep 'Private key:' | awk '{print $3}')
```

<Note>
Provide a password to encrypt the keystore file when running the above command. If you forget this password, you will not be able to recover it.
</Note>

Get your wallet address:

```shell
cast wallet address --account skale-deployer
```

Copy the address and head over to the [sFUEL Station](https://sfuelstation). Input the address, toggle testnet, and fill up on your SKALE Chain.

<Tip>
Make sure you toggle testnet on first if you're using a testnet chain!
</Tip>

## Step 9: Deploy the Contract

Deploy your ERC-20 token to SKALE:

```shell
forge create src/MyERC20.sol:MyERC20 \
    --account skale-deployer \
    --rpc-url skale_testnet \
    --broadcast \
    --legacy
```

<Note>
The `--legacy` flag is required for SKALE Chains. For more information, see [Troubleshooting](/developers/troubleshooting).
</Note>

A successful deployment should look something like this:

```shell
Enter keystore password:
Deployer: 0x63a38D694de837dDF765f9b2704814275586D812
Deployed to: 0x4A435f6E471f773173774E860EBDcd17B132a2b4
Transaction hash: 0x3f6cc66e860cb82a6a62e3f5181c401e5558d60d622a9157437002e16c1ce488
```

## Step 10: Verify Your Smart Contract

Verify your smart contract on the block explorer:

```shell
forge verify-contract \
    --rpc-url skale_testnet \
    <DEPLOYED_ADDRESS> \
    src/MyERC20.sol:MyERC20 \
    --verifier blockscout \
    --verifier-url https://juicy-low-small-testnet.explorer.testnet.skalenodes.com/api
```

Replace `<DEPLOYED_ADDRESS>` with your deployed contract address.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed an ERC-20 token on SKALE. You can now:

- Transfer tokens to other addresses
- Approve spending allowances
- Integrate the token into your dApp

## Deploy an ERC-1155 Token

This tutorial will walk you through deploying an ERC-1155 token on SKALE using Foundry and OpenZeppelin Contracts. ERC-1155 is a multi-token standard that can represent both fungible and non-fungible tokens in a single contract, making it ideal for games, marketplaces, and applications that need to manage multiple token types efficiently.

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed on your machine
- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh) installed
- A wallet with sFUEL
- Basic knowledge of Solidity
- A SKALE Chain endpoint

<Note>
If you are on a Windows machine, you will need to use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), since Foundry doesn't work natively on Windows.
</Note>

## Step 1: Install Foundry

If you haven't already installed Foundry, run:

```shell
foundryup
```

## Step 2: Create a New Foundry Project

Run the following in your terminal:

```shell
forge init my-erc1155-token
cd my-erc1155-token
```

## Step 3: Install OpenZeppelin Contracts

Install OpenZeppelin Contracts using Foundry:

```shell
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
```

This will add OpenZeppelin Contracts to your `lib` directory.

## Step 4: Configure Remappings

Update your `remappings.txt` file (or create it if it doesn't exist) to include:

```
@openzeppelin/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/
```

## Step 5: Update Foundry Configuration

Update the `foundry.toml` file to add your SKALE Chain endpoint:

```toml
[profile.default]
src = "src"
out = "out"
libs = ["lib"]

# SKALE Chain Configuration
[rpc_endpoints]
skale_testnet = "https://testnet.skalenodes.com/v1/juicy-low-small-testnet"
# Replace with your SKALE Chain endpoint
```

## Step 6: Create the ERC-1155 Contract

Create a new file `src/MyERC1155.sol`:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol";

contract MyERC1155 is ERC1155 {
    // Token IDs
    uint256 public constant GOLD = 0;
    uint256 public constant SILVER = 1;
    uint256 public constant SWORD = 2;
    uint256 public constant SHIELD = 3;

    constructor() ERC1155("https://myapi.com/api/token/{id}.json") {
        // Mint initial supply
        _mint(msg.sender, GOLD, 1000, "");      // 1000 gold tokens (fungible)
        _mint(msg.sender, SILVER, 500, "");     // 500 silver tokens (fungible)
        _mint(msg.sender, SWORD, 1, "");        // 1 sword (non-fungible)
        _mint(msg.sender, SHIELD, 1, "");       // 1 shield (non-fungible)
    }

    function mint(address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount) public {
        _mint(to, id, amount, "");
    }

    function mintBatch(
        address to,
        uint256[] memory ids,
        uint256[] memory amounts
    ) public {
        _mintBatch(to, ids, amounts, "");
    }
}
```

This contract:
- Inherits from OpenZeppelin's `ERC1155` contract
- Defines multiple token types (GOLD, SILVER, SWORD, SHIELD)
- Sets a base URI for metadata (replace with your own)
- Includes `mint` function for single token minting
- Includes `mintBatch` function for efficient batch minting
- Mints initial supply to the deployer upon deployment

<Note>
The URI parameter in the constructor uses `{id}` as a placeholder that will be replaced with the actual token ID. Make sure your metadata server handles this correctly.
</Note>

## Step 7: Compile the Contract

Compile your contract:

```shell
forge build
```

## Step 8: Prepare Signer for Deployment

This tutorial uses the Foundry Keystore for increased security. Create a new keystore:

```shell
cast wallet import skale-deployer --private-key $(cast wallet new | grep 'Private key:' | awk '{print $3}')
```

<Note>
Provide a password to encrypt the keystore file when running the above command. If you forget this password, you will not be able to recover it.
</Note>

Get your wallet address:

```shell
cast wallet address --account skale-deployer
```

Copy the address and head over to the [sFUEL Station](https://sfuelstation). Input the address, toggle testnet, and fill up on your SKALE Chain.

<Tip>
Make sure you toggle testnet on first if you're using a testnet chain!
</Tip>

## Step 9: Deploy the Contract

Deploy your ERC-1155 token to SKALE:

```shell
forge create src/MyERC1155.sol:MyERC1155 \
    --account skale-deployer \
    --rpc-url skale_testnet \
    --broadcast \
    --legacy
```

<Note>
The `--legacy` flag is required for SKALE Chains. For more information, see [Troubleshooting](/developers/troubleshooting).
</Note>

A successful deployment should look something like this:

```shell
Enter keystore password:
Deployer: 0x63a38D694de837dDF765f9b2704814275586D812
Deployed to: 0x4A435f6E471f773173774E860EBDcd17B132a2b4
Transaction hash: 0x3f6cc66e860cb82a6a62e3f5181c401e5558d60d622a9157437002e16c1ce488
```

## Step 10: Mint Additional Tokens

After deployment, you can mint additional tokens. For example, to mint more gold:

```shell
cast send <DEPLOYED_ADDRESS> \
    "mint(address,uint256,uint256)" \
    <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS> \
    0 \
    100 \
    --account skale-deployer \
    --rpc-url skale_testnet \
    --legacy
```

This mints 100 GOLD tokens (ID 0) to the recipient address.

To mint multiple token types in a single transaction (batch minting):

```shell
cast send <DEPLOYED_ADDRESS> \
    "mintBatch(address,uint256[],uint256[])" \
    <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS> \
    "[2,3]" \
    "[1,1]" \
    --account skale-deployer \
    --rpc-url skale_testnet \
    --legacy
```

This mints 1 SWORD (ID 2) and 1 SHIELD (ID 3) to the recipient in a single transaction.

## Step 11: Verify Your Smart Contract

Verify your smart contract on the block explorer:

```shell
forge verify-contract \
    --rpc-url skale_testnet \
    <DEPLOYED_ADDRESS> \
    src/MyERC1155.sol:MyERC1155 \
    --verifier blockscout \
    --verifier-url https://juicy-low-small-testnet.explorer.testnet.skalenodes.com/api
```

Replace `<DEPLOYED_ADDRESS>` with your deployed contract address.

## Advanced: Adding Access Control

To restrict minting to only the contract owner, you can add OpenZeppelin's `Ownable`:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract MyERC1155WithOwnable is ERC1155, Ownable {
    uint256 public constant GOLD = 0;
    uint256 public constant SILVER = 1;

    constructor(address initialOwner)
        ERC1155("https://myapi.com/api/token/{id}.json")
        Ownable(initialOwner)
    {}

    function mint(address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
        _mint(to, id, amount, "");
    }

    function mintBatch(
        address to,
        uint256[] memory ids,
        uint256[] memory amounts
    ) public onlyOwner {
        _mintBatch(to, ids, amounts, "");
    }
}
```

## Next Steps

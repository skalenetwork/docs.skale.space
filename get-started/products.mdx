## Overview

SKALE Network offers three main product types to suit different use cases and requirements. Each product type provides unique benefits and is designed for specific scenarios.

## Gas Chains (Hub Chains)

Gas Chains, also known as SKALE Hubs, are shared SKALE Chains designed to be used by many projects. These chains offer zero gas fees and are ideal for developers who want to start building quickly without the overhead of managing their own chain.

### Key Features

- **Zero Gas Fees**: Users and developers don't pay gas fees
- **Shared Resources**: Multiple projects share the same chain resources
- **Quick Start**: Start building immediately without setup requirements
- **High Throughput**: Process hundreds of transactions per second
- **Decentralized Storage**: Hundreds of gigabytes of storage available

### Available Hub Chains

The four SKALE Hubs available today are:

- **Calypso**: Consumer, Social, DePIN
- **Europa**: DeFi, RWAs, Stablecoins, Onchain Finance
- **Nebula**: Gaming
- **Titan**: Artificial Intelligence (AI)

### When to Use Gas Chains

Gas Chains are ideal for:
- Developers starting out on SKALE
- Projects that don't need dedicated resources
- Applications that benefit from shared infrastructure
- Quick prototyping and testing

## App Chains (Dedicated SKALE Chains)

App Chains are dedicated SKALE Chains fully dedicated to a single application or a small subset of applications. Each App Chain operates independently with its own resources and configuration.

### Key Features

- **Dedicated Resources**: Full control over chain resources
- **Customization**: Configure chain parameters to your needs
- **Privacy**: Isolated environment for sensitive applications
- **Scalability**: Scale resources based on your requirements
- **Access Control**: Configure who can interact with your chain

### Chain Sizes

SKALE Network offers different chain sizes:

| Chain Name | Node Resources | Cost per Month* |
| - | - | - |
| Hub Chain | 1/8 | $7200* |
| Performance Chain | 1/32 | $7200* |

<Note>
SKALE Hub Chains have a long term price target of $500,000-$1,000,000 USD per year per chain.
Performance chains are recommended for most applications looking to come build on SKALE who don't
want to launch on one of the existing hub chains.
</Note>

### When to Use App Chains

App Chains are ideal for:
- Applications requiring dedicated resources
- Enterprise deployments needing privacy and compliance
- High-throughput applications
- Projects requiring custom chain configurations
- Applications needing access control

## Credit Chains

Credit Chains are SKALE Chains designed for applications that require credit-based or subscription-based payment models. These chains enable innovative economic models where users can interact with applications using credits or subscriptions rather than per-transaction fees.

### Key Features

- **Credit-Based Payments**: Users interact using credits instead of gas tokens
- **Subscription Models**: Support for subscription-based access
- **Flexible Economics**: Customize payment models for your application
- **Zero Gas Fees**: Maintain zero gas fees while enabling credit systems
- **User-Friendly**: Simplified payment experience for end users

### Use Cases

Credit Chains are ideal for:
- Subscription-based applications
- Credit-based gaming platforms
- Freemium models
- Applications with internal economies
- Services requiring prepaid access

### Implementation

Credit Chains leverage SKALE's zero gas fee model while enabling applications to implement their own credit or subscription systems on top. This allows for innovative economic models that aren't possible on traditional blockchains.

## Choosing the Right Product

| Product | Best For | Setup Time | Cost |
| ------- | -------- | ---------- | ---- |
| Gas Chain (Hub) | Quick start, shared resources | Immediate | Free for developers |
| App Chain | Dedicated resources, privacy | Days to weeks | Monthly subscription |
| Credit Chain | Credit/subscription models | Days to weeks | Monthly subscription |

#### Notes
- When bridging ETH from Base Sepolia to the SKALE Chain, the ETH is locked as native ETH (msg.value) and is minted as an ERC-20 called ETHC on the SKALE Chain.
On the frontend you can show it as ETH.
- WETH and ETHC are both ERC-20 on the SKALE Chain but are deposited differently. WETH is deposited as WETH on Base.
- This testnet chain is 100% permissionless.
- CREATE2Factory, SingletonFactory, and Multicall3 are deployed to their canonical addresses on this chain

## Introduction

Autonomous agents can now discover each other, communicate, and move value — **for real**.

A growing set of open standards and platforms already exists:
- HTTP-native payments
- Agent discovery and identity
- Agent-to-agent messaging
- Cheap (or zero-gas) execution environments

What’s still early is seeing these pieces **composed together** into working systems, experiments, and new kinds of businesses.  
This hackathon is a space to explore exactly that.

### The Tech Landscape

Here are some of the building blocks available to you.

#### Payments & Commerce

- **x402** — native HTTP payments for APIs, resources, and services  
- **Commerce primitives** — escrow, conditional payments, settlement flows  
- **SKALE Chains** — instant finallity, encrypted txs with BITE (v1 and v2) protocol, support for agentic payment standards  

These tools make it practical for agents to pay each other, meter usage, or settle value without constant human involvement.

#### Agent Identity & Communication

- **ERC-8004** — agent discovery and interaction standard  
- **Agent registries & reputation systems** — discoverable, composable agents  
- **Google AP2 / A2A** — agent-to-agent communication protocols  

This layer is about agents finding each other, negotiating, coordinating, and exchanging intent.

#### Agent Frameworks

- **LangChain**
- **OpenAI / Anthropic**
- **Virtuals**

Use these to define agent behavior, reasoning, and workflows — whether fully autonomous or human-supervised.

#### Chain Notes

- When bridging ETH from Base Sepolia to the SKALE Chain, ETH is locked as native ETH (msg.value) and minted as an ERC-20 called ETHC on the SKALE Chain
- WETH and ETHC are both ERC-20 on the SKALE Chain but are deposited differently
- This testnet chain is 100% permissionless
- CREATE2Factory, SingletonFactory, Multicall3, and Permit2 are deployed to their canonical addresses

## Quick Concepts and Demos

Building on SKALE and agentic commerce involves a set of core concepts, tools, and smart contracts that work together.

This section introduces those concepts and links to deeper explanations, along with demos that show how they can be used and composed in practice.

### SKALE Native Features

#### Random Number Generation (RNG)

Verifiable randomness directly on-chain — SKALE Chains RNG is 100% mathematical provable, decentralized and does not relay on any third party.

#### SKALE Native Bridge

SKALE Native Bridge or SKALE’s Interchain Messaging Agent (IMA) is a decentralized, high-performance message transport layer and bridging protocol.

#### BITE Transaction

On SKALE Chains it's possible to send encrypted transactions. How? Using the native threshold encryption utilized on the concensus and mantains the chain secure.

With the native threshold encryption of SKALE Chains it was create the BITE Protocol - it allows to encrypt transactions and only after consensus does the validator committee decrypt for execution using threshold keys—no single party can peek or tamper early.

As of now the BITE protocol it's at phase 2, which means it can be used in two different ways:
- BITE V1: transaction gets ecrypted on the client side and gets decrypted during consensus;
- BITE V2 or BITE CTX: transaction gets ecrypted on the client and decrypt on the smart contract when some condition is met (defined on the contract);

**MEV Protection**

Encrypted mempool means front-running, sandwiching, and other MEV attacks are prevented. Using BITE protocol it's possible to fully prevent MEV in a decentralized manner.

### Agentic Commerce

#### Agents

Autonomous software programs that can discover services, negotiate terms, and execute transactions on behalf of users or other agents.

</CardGroup>

#### A2A (Agent-to-Agent)

Direct communication and value exchange between agents. No intermediary required — agents discover, negotiate, and settle peer-to-peer.

  <Card title="Documentation" icon="book" href="https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

#### ERC-8004

The standard for agent discovery and interaction. Agents register themselves, announce capabilities, and become discoverable to other agents and systems.

  <Card title="Documentation" icon="book" href="/get-started/agentic-builders/start-with-erc-8004">
    ERC-8004 specification.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

#### x402

HTTP-native payments for APIs and services. Inspired by HTTP 402 "Payment Required" — makes any API monetizable without blockchain complexity.

On the x402 payment protocol there's different parties involved to make this kind of payment possible:
- **Facilitator**: Off-chain entity that handles BITE V2 decryption and payment routing
- **Merchant**:  Agent or service offering goods/services for payment
- **Buyer**: Agent or user purchasing goods/services
- **Agent**: Autonomous actor that can be a buyer, merchant, or both (optional)

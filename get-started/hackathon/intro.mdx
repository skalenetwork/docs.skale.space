## What This Hackathon Is About

Autonomous agents can now discover each other, communicate, and move value — **for real**.

A growing set of open standards and platforms already exists:
- HTTP-native payments
- Agent discovery and identity
- Agent-to-agent messaging
- Cheap (or zero-gas) execution environments

What’s still early is seeing these pieces **composed together** into working systems, experiments, and new kinds of businesses.  
This hackathon is a space to explore exactly that.

## The Tech Landscape

Here are some of the building blocks available to you.

### Payments & Commerce

- **x402** — native HTTP payments for APIs, resources, and services  
- **Commerce primitives** — escrow, conditional payments, settlement flows  
- **SKALE Chains** — instant finallity, encrypted txs with BITE (v1 and v2) protocol, support for agentic payment standards  

These tools make it practical for agents to pay each other, meter usage, or settle value without constant human involvement.

### Agent Identity & Communication

- **ERC-8004** — agent discovery and interaction standard  
- **Agent registries & reputation systems** — discoverable, composable agents  
- **Google AP2 / A2A** — agent-to-agent communication protocols  

This layer is about agents finding each other, negotiating, coordinating, and exchanging intent.

### Agent Frameworks

- **LangChain**
- **OpenAI / Anthropic**
- **Virtuals**

Use these to define agent behavior, reasoning, and workflows — whether fully autonomous or human-supervised.

## Overview

SKALE enables artificial intelligence applications that require confidential computing, high throughput, and cost-effective operations. With BITE protocol support for confidential applications (cApps) and zero gas fees, SKALE is ideal for AI workloads that need to process sensitive data securely.

## Key Features for AI

### Confidential Computing

SKALE's BITE protocol enables confidential applications (cApps) that can process sensitive AI data securely within the blockchain environment. This is critical for AI applications that handle private data, model weights, or training data.

### Zero Gas Fees

AI applications often require millions of operations for training, inference, and data processing. SKALE's zero gas fee model makes it economically viable to run AI workloads at scale.

### High Throughput

SKALE can process thousands of transactions per second, enabling real-time AI inference and training operations without network congestion.

### Agent Support

SKALE is purpose-built for autonomous agents, making it ideal for AI agents that need to interact with smart contracts, process data, and make decisions autonomously.

## Use Cases

- **Confidential AI Training**: Train AI models on sensitive data with privacy guarantees
- **AI Agents**: Deploy autonomous AI agents that can interact with smart contracts
- **Federated Learning**: Coordinate distributed AI training across multiple parties
- **AI Inference Services**: Provide AI inference as a service with confidential compute
- **Model Marketplace**: Create marketplaces for AI models with privacy-preserving verification
- **Data Processing**: Process large datasets for AI training with confidential compute

## BITE Protocol for AI

The BITE (Blockchain Interoperability and Trustless Execution) protocol enables:

- **Confidential Data Processing**: Process sensitive AI data securely
- **Trustless Execution**: Execute AI workloads without trusted intermediaries
- **Cross-Chain AI**: Coordinate AI operations across multiple blockchain networks
- **Privacy-Preserving AI**: Build AI applications that protect data privacy

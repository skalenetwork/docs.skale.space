## Overview

SKALE enables consumer applications that require seamless user experiences, zero transaction costs, and instant confirmation. With zero gas fees and instant finality, SKALE removes the friction that prevents mainstream adoption of blockchain applications.

## Key Features for Consumer Apps

### Zero Gas Fees

Users don't need to purchase or manage gas tokens to interact with applications. This removes a major barrier to entry for consumer applications.

### Instant Finality

Transactions are confirmed immediately, providing a seamless user experience similar to traditional web applications.

### High Throughput

SKALE can handle millions of users and transactions, making it suitable for consumer applications at scale.

### EVM Compatibility

Developers can use familiar tools and frameworks, making it easy to build consumer applications.

## Use Cases

- **Social Media**: Decentralized social platforms with zero transaction costs
- **Gaming**: Blockchain-based games where users don't pay gas fees
- **Content Creation**: Platforms for creators to monetize content without gas costs
- **Marketplaces**: E-commerce and NFT marketplaces with instant transactions
- **Streaming**: Content streaming platforms with micropayment support

description: "Deploy AI agents that think, transact, and scale without the friction of traditional blockchains."

**The big picture:** AI agents have graduated from hackathon novelties to production-ready tools. However, for an agent to be truly autonomous, it needs open-protocols and infrastructure that doesn't penalize it for for use and doesn't expose unnecessary information.

Current blockchains enforce a variable cost on every transaction while SKALE removes the dynamicness and provides a flat compute cost similiar to traditional cloud computing. 

In their *State of Crypto 2025* report, a16z identified AI and Crypto as the definitive breakout category. For agentic commerce to become a reality, the ability to negotiate, buy, and sell independently are critical. These features : **Predictable costs, instant finality, and data sovereignty.**

## Key Use Cases

### 1. Agentic Commerce & x402
The future of the world is agents paying agents and machines paying machines funded by humans. Using the **x402 protocol** on SKALE, developers can easily implement "pay-per-use" or automated machine-to-machine micro-subscriptions. It transforms agents from simple bots into economic actors.

### 2. Agentic Discovery & Agent-2-Agent (A2A)
Agents are only as good as the information and resources they have access to. ERC-8004 defines a protocol for trustless agent discovery, reputation, and feedback while x402 also includes a native discovery system. There are also other open and closed sourced protocols and solutions that work directly on SKALE to help you build agents that can truly be autonomous.

<Note>
Agent cards can live directly in SKALE File Storage offering a unique mutuable and cost effective option for companies offering agentic card hosting.

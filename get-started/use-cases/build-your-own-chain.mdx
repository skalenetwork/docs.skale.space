description: "Deploy your own dedicated SKALE Chain with full customization"
---

Deploy your own blockchain with complete control over configuration, access, and resources. Build private chains for enterprise, public chains for apps, or specialized chains for specific needs.

App teams are moving from shared L2s to dedicated appchains to control UX, cost, and roadmaps. SKALE lets you claim a chain with zero gas for users, strong privacy controls, and bridged connectivity to Ethereum when you need liquidity.

## Why a dedicated SKALE Chain

- **Own your SLOs** — Dedicated validator resources keep performance consistent during promos, mints, and game spikes.
- **Design your economics** — Flat monthly cost, zero gas for users; tune access control, fee policies, and security posture per app.
- **Ship privately, interop publicly** — Isolated execution for compliance and IP protection; bridge to Ethereum and other chains for liquidity or settlement.
- **Future-proof** — Upgrade parameters without migrating users; keep contracts, assets, and data intact.

## Fit Checklist

- You need predictable throughput for real-time UX (games, payments, auctions).
- You own sensitive data or IP and need scoped access control.
- Your roadmap includes frequent balance changes, live ops, or seasonal content.
- You want to keep fees invisible to users while retaining L1 exit options.

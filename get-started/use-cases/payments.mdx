## Overview

SKALE is ideal for building payment systems that require high throughput, instant finality, and predictable costs. With zero gas fees and instant transaction finality, SKALE enables payment applications that can scale to billions of transactions.

## Key Features for Payments

### Instant Finality

SKALE transactions achieve instant finality, meaning payments are confirmed immediately without waiting for multiple block confirmations. This is critical for payment systems where users expect immediate confirmation.

### Flat Cost Structure

Unlike traditional blockchains where gas costs fluctuate, SKALE offers a flat cost structure. Chain owners pay a predictable monthly fee, enabling payment applications to operate with consistent economics regardless of network activity.

### High Throughput

SKALE Chains can process thousands of transactions per second, making them suitable for high-volume payment applications.

## Use Cases

- **Micropayments**: Zero gas fees enable economically viable micropayments
- **Real-time Payments**: Instant finality enables real-time payment processing
- **Cross-border Payments**: Fast, low-cost international payments
- **Subscription Services**: Predictable costs enable subscription-based payment models
- **Agent-to-Agent Payments**: Autonomous agents can make payments without gas cost concerns

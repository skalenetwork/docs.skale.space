## Overview

SKALE enables enterprises and government organizations to deploy private, siloed compute environments while maintaining connection to public blockchains. This architecture provides the security and compliance requirements of private infrastructure with the interoperability of public blockchains.

## Key Features

### Siloed Compute

Each SKALE Chain operates as an isolated environment, perfect for organizations that require data privacy and regulatory compliance. Your data and transactions remain private within your chain while still being able to interact with public blockchains when needed.

### Connected to Public Blockchains

SKALE Chains can bridge assets and messages to and from public blockchains like Ethereum, enabling hybrid architectures that combine private and public blockchain benefits.

### BITE Protocol

The BITE (Blockchain Interoperability and Trustless Execution) protocol enables secure cross-chain communication and trustless execution, critical for enterprise deployments that need to interact with multiple blockchain networks.

## Use Cases

- **Regulated Industries**: Financial services, healthcare, and other regulated industries can deploy compliant blockchain solutions
- **Government Services**: Public sector applications requiring data sovereignty and compliance
- **Supply Chain**: Private supply chain tracking with public verification capabilities
- **Identity Management**: Private identity systems with selective public verification
- **Confidential Transactions**: Financial transactions requiring privacy and compliance

## Architecture

SKALE's architecture enables:

- **Private Chains**: Fully isolated SKALE Chains for sensitive operations
- **Public Bridges**: Secure bridges to public blockchains when needed
- **Compliance**: Built-in features for regulatory compliance
- **Scalability**: Scale to handle enterprise-level transaction volumes

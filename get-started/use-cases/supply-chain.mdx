## Overview

SKALE enables supply chain applications that require confidential transaction details while maintaining public verification capabilities. With BITE protocol support and siloed compute environments, SKALE is ideal for supply chain use cases that need to protect sensitive business data while enabling transparency and traceability.

## Key Features for Supply Chain

### Confidential Tracking

SKALE's BITE protocol enables confidential supply chain tracking that protects sensitive business information while maintaining traceability.

### Public Verification

SKALE Chains can bridge to public blockchains, enabling public verification of supply chain events while keeping transaction details private.

### Multi-Party Coordination

SKALE's messaging layer enables secure coordination between multiple parties in the supply chain without exposing sensitive data.

### Regulatory Compliance

Siloed compute environments enable supply chain applications to meet regulatory requirements while maintaining data privacy.

## Use Cases

- **Food Safety**: Track food products from farm to table with confidential transaction details
- **Pharmaceutical Supply Chain**: Secure pharmaceutical tracking with regulatory compliance
- **Luxury Goods**: Authenticate luxury goods while protecting supply chain details
- **Raw Materials**: Track raw materials with confidential pricing and sourcing information
- **Logistics**: Coordinate logistics operations with privacy-preserving data sharing
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generate compliance reports while maintaining data confidentiality

## BITE Protocol for Supply Chain

The BITE protocol enables:

- **Confidential Transactions**: Protect sensitive supply chain data while maintaining traceability
- **Multi-Party Coordination**: Enable secure coordination between supply chain participants
- **Public Verification**: Provide public verification of supply chain events when needed
- **Cross-Chain Integration**: Integrate with multiple blockchain networks and traditional systems

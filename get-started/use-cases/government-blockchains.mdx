Deploy private, siloed compute environments while maintaining connection to public blockchains. Get the security and compliance of private infrastructure with the interoperability of public chains.

a16z’s State of Crypto 2025 underscores how regulated industries are moving to hybrid architectures—private execution with public settlement rails[1]. SKALE’s isolated chains with bridges let agencies and enterprises control data residency while still tapping Ethereum liquidity and verification when required.

## Why SKALE for regulated workloads

- **Isolated execution** — Dedicated chains keep citizen or customer data private while meeting residency and sovereignty requirements.
- **Controlled interoperability** — Bridge to Ethereum only when you choose, using BITE Protocol for verifiable cross-chain calls.
- **Predictable cost** — Flat monthly pricing simplifies procurement and budgeting compared to variable-fee networks.
- **Operational control** — Access control and upgrade paths let you evolve policy without renegotiating with shared L2s.

## Programs teams build

### Digital services and permits
Issue licenses, permits, and benefits on a private chain; surface proofs to public networks for transparency where needed.

### Supply chain and provenance
Track goods with confidential data on SKALE while exposing hashed proofs or NFTs to public marketplaces for verification.

### Confidential payments and settlement
Handle stablecoin-based payouts with instant finality and no gas for users; bridge summaries to Ethereum for auditability.

### Identity and credentials
Store verifiable credentials privately; share attestations selectively with partners and agencies.

## Implementation Path

1) Stand up an isolated chain via [Run a SKALE Chain](/developers/run-a-skale-chain/intro-to-schains) and configure permissions with [Access Control](/developers/run-a-skale-chain/access-control).  
2) Define what stays private vs what is bridged; wire [BITE Protocol](/concepts/bite-protocol/intro-bite-protocol) for verifiable cross-chain calls.  
3) Pilot with one workflow, measure latency/compliance, then expand coverage with staged rollouts.

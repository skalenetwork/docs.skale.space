Deploy private, siloed compute environments while maintaining connection to public blockchains. Get the security and compliance of private infrastructure with the interoperability of public chains.

## Features

**Siloed compute** - Each chain operates as an isolated environment for data privacy and regulatory compliance.

**Public bridges** - Connect to Ethereum and other blockchains when needed.

**BITE Protocol** - Secure cross-chain communication and trustless execution.

## Use Cases

- Regulated industries (financial services, healthcare)
- Government services
- Supply chain tracking
- Identity management
- Confidential transactions

SKALE is a network of interconnected Layer 1 blockchains built different
to scale gaming, AI, DeFi, and other decentralized applications. This page
similar to a table of contents and provides an introduction to the various products and tools
available within the SKALE Ecosystem.

### For Developers

Interested in building on the fastest blockchain in the world with zero gas fees?
You can start building on SKALE in minutes with one of the SKALE Hubs. SKALE Hubs are SKALE Chains
designed to be shared by many projects instead of being dedicated to a single application. Checkout some of the most
popular developer docs below!

| Section | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [Intro to Solidity](/developers/solidity-quickstart) | A quick introduction to the most popular language on SKALE |
| [Zero Gas Fees](/concepts/gas-fees/zero-gas-fees) | Jump start your knowledge of how to use zero gas fees on SKALE |
| [Picking a Chain](/developers/pick-a-chain) | Checkout the various SKALE Hubs to determine where to build |
| [SKALE vs Ethereum](/developers/skale-vs-ethereum) | Coming from Ethereum or another EVM? Checkout the comparison guide |

### For SKALE Chain Owners

Interested in having your own blockchain? It has never been easier to have your own
blockchain with the full security of a Layer 1.

### For Validators

Real blockchains require validators or node operators to run the network. SKALE being a network of Layer 1's
requires strong validator operators to be a part of the network. Check out some of the most common resources below
to get started as a validator.

<Note>
SKALE utilizes a shared security model where validators are responsible for securing multiple chains.
This is different from other networks where validators are responsible for securing a single chain.
Joining the SKALE Network as a validator means you will be providing resources to the global validator pool
and then randomly rotated on and off of active SKALE Chains.

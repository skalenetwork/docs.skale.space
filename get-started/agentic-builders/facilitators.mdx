description: "Explore the available facilitators on SKALE and how they support x402"
---

The facilitation process in x402 -- verification and settlement of payments -- is critical to ensuring the resource is paid for properly. While the process is 100% self-hostable by the seller, hosted facilitators like PayAI and x402 reduce the scope of integration into x402 by letting sellers of resources quickly and easily accept payments without any knowledge of blockchain, sending transactions, or gas fees.

On SKALE, facilitators support both SKALE Base (Mainnet) and SKALE Base Sepolia (Testnet) networks, providing a drop-in solution for processing x402 payments.

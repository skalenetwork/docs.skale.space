Facilitators are infrastructure providers in the x402 protocol that enable seamless cross-chain payment processing. They handle the complexity of blockchain interactions, allowing developers to accept payments across multiple networks without managing API keys or dealing with blockchain infrastructure directly. 

On SKALE, facilitators support both SKALE Base and SKALE Base Sepolia networks, providing a drop-in solution for payment processing.

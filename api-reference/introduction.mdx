## Overview

SKALE Chains implement the Ethereum JSON-RPC API specification, providing full compatibility with Ethereum tooling and libraries. This reference documents all available JSON-RPC methods, their parameters, return values, and compatibility across different node types.

<Note>
Use the interactive API playground above to test JSON-RPC methods against different SKALE chains. Select your chain from the server dropdown and try the example requests.
</Note>

## Node Types

SKALE supports three types of nodes, each with different capabilities:

- **Core Node** - Participates in consensus and block production
- **Full Sync Node** - Syncs all blocks but doesn't participate in consensus
- **Archive Node** - Stores complete historical data including rotated blocks

## Method Compatibility

Methods are marked with compatibility indicators:

- 🟢 **Fully Supported** - Works as expected on all node types
- 🟡 **Partially Supported** - Works with limitations (see notes)
- 🔴 **Not Supported** - Method is not available

## Getting Started

To interact with a SKALE Chain via JSON-RPC:

1. **Select a Chain** - Choose from the server dropdown above (includes all mainnet and testnet chains)
2. **Choose Node Type** - Select Core, Full Sync, or Archive based on your needs
3. **Make Requests** - Use standard JSON-RPC 2.0 format

### Interactive API Playground

The API playground above allows you to:

- **Test Methods** - Try different JSON-RPC methods interactively
- **Switch Chains** - Test against different SKALE chains using the server dropdown
- **View Responses** - See real responses from the selected chain
- **Copy Examples** - Use the examples as templates for your code

### Available Chains

The playground includes the following SKALE chains:

**Mainnet:**
- Calypso (honorable-steel-rasalhague) - Social, DePIN
- Europa (elated-tan-skat) - DeFi & Liquidity
- Nebula (green-giddy-denebola) - Gaming
- Titan (parallel-stormy-spica) - AI

**Testnet:**
- Calypso Testnet (giant-half-dual-testnet) - Social, DePIN
- Europa Testnet (elated-tan-skat) - DeFi & Liquidity
- Nebula Testnet (lanky-ill-funny-testnet) - Gaming
- Titan Testnet (aware-fake-trim-testnet) - AI
- SKALE Base Sepolia (jubilant-horrible-ancha) - SKALE on Base

## Overview

SKALE Chains implement the Ethereum JSON-RPC API specification, providing full compatibility with Ethereum tooling and libraries. This reference documents all available JSON-RPC methods, their parameters, return values, and compatibility across different node types.

## Node Types

SKALE supports three types of nodes, each with different capabilities:

- **Core Node** - Participates in consensus and block production
- **Full Sync Node** - Syncs all blocks but doesn't participate in consensus
- **Archive Node** - Stores complete historical data including rotated blocks

## Method Compatibility

Methods are marked with compatibility indicators:

- 🟢 **Fully Supported** - Works as expected on all node types
- 🟡 **Partially Supported** - Works with limitations (see notes)
- 🔴 **Not Supported** - Method is not available

## Getting Started

To interact with a SKALE Chain via JSON-RPC:

1. **Select a Chain** - Choose from available SKALE chains (see [Chain Info](/get-started/chain-info))
2. **Choose Node Type** - Select Core, Full Sync, or Archive based on your needs
3. **Make Requests** - Use standard JSON-RPC 2.0 format

For a complete list with chain IDs and explorers, see [Chain Info](/get-started/chain-info).

## Method Documentation

Each JSON-RPC method has detailed documentation with request/response examples. Browse the methods below or use the [Compatibility Table](/api-reference/compatibility) to find methods by compatibility status.

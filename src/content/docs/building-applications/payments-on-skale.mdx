Payments and tokenization is currently one of the most common usecases within the blockchain space.
It's important to recognize that with [zero gas fees](/building-applications/zero-gas-fees) on SKALE, the way you handle payments and tokenization
may require a small change compared to other networks.

## Background

There are two types of tokens that are generally used for "payments" or "fungible value transfer" on most blockchains:

1. **Native Token:** the native token of the blockchain (e.g. ETH on Ethereum, etc.)
2. **ERC-20 Tokens:** tokens that are built on top of the blockchain (e.g. DAI, USDC, etc.)

When you're building an application that faciliates payments on Ethereum and other chains that have gas fees, many developers utilize the native gas
token as a primary form of payment. This is because the gas token is generally the most liquid asset and easiest to attain for users since they need it to execute
transactions.

However, on SKALE, with zero gas fees or [gasless transactions](/building-applications/gasless-transactions); you <span style="color: red;">cannot use</span> the native token as form of payment at all
as it has **0 monetary value**. Therefore, you should use other forms of value such as ERC-20 tokens or other tokens that have value on the network.

## Technical Comparison

### Using Native Gas for Payments (BAD)

The following is how to transfer assets into a smart contract as a payment using the native gas token. In Solidity, this is msg.value.
This should <span style="color: red;">not</span> be done on SKALE as the native token has no value.

<Code code={nativePaymentCode} lang="solidity" title="NativePayment.sol" />

<Aside type="danger">
DO NOT DO THIS ON ANY SKALE CHAIN. THIS WILL RESULT IN TAKING PAYMENT IN A TOKEN THAT HAS NO VALUE.
</Aside>

### Using ERC-20 for Payments (GOOD)

The following is how to use an ERC-20 token for payments. This is the recommended way to handle payments on SKALE.
<Code code={erc20PaymentCode} lang="solidity" title="ERC20Payment.sol" />

<Aside type="note">
- Many tokens such as USDC, USDT, etc. are ERC-20 tokens on SKALE already. You can use any ERC-20 either pre-existing or your own.
- Don't forget to approve the the contract spending tokens before you call `purchase` function, otherwise it will fail.

import { Aside, Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

This introduction is perfect for most developers or programmers who have some basic experience writing code and that are interested in building
**decentralized applications** or dApps on SKALE! If you run into any trouble or have questions throughout this guide or at any point in time when
building on SKALE, head over to the [SKALE Discord](https://discord.gg/skale) for support!

2. Deploying a smart contract
3. Testing the smart contract

### Preqrequisites

<Steps>
1. ### Prepare Dev Environemnt
    - Ensure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed on your machine.
    - Install [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh) if you do not have it installed on your machine
    
    Run the following in your terminal to install the development tools:
    ```shell
    foundryup
    ```

    <Aside type="note">
    If you are on a Windows machine, you will need to use Window Subystem for Linux (WSL); since Foundry doesn't work nativley on Windows.
    </Aside>
2. ### Create a New Foundry Project

    Run the following in your terminal:
    ```shell
    forge init my-first-contract
    ```

3. ### Modify Foundry Configuration
    Update the `foundry.toml` file to add SKALE Europa Testnet
    
    ```toml
    [profile.default]
    src = "src"
    out = "out"
    libs = ["lib"]

    # SKALE Europa Testnet Configuration
    [rpc_endpoints]
    skale_testnet="https://testnet.skalenodes.com/v1/juicy-low-small-testnet"
    ```
4. ### The Smart Contract
    Smart contracts are created under the `src` folder. There is already a `Counter.sol` contract in the project located at `src/Counter.sol`.

    ```solidity
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
    pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

    contract Counter {
        uint256 public number;

        function setNumber(uint256 newNumber) public {
            number = newNumber;
        }

        function increment() public {
            number++;
        }
    }
    ```

    This smart contract has two public `write` functions and 1 public `read` function.
    The write functions are `setNumber` and `increment` which allow the sender to set any number of increment by one (1) respectivley.
    The read function allows anyone to read the current number set in the contract.

5. ### Compile the Smart Contract

    Compilation is the process of taking Solidity smart contracts in the `src` folder and compiling them to EVM compatible bytecode and ABIs which offchain programs
    use to interact with the smart contract. You can find the output of the compilation process in the `out` folder.

    ```shell
    forge compile
    ```

6. ### Prepare Signer for Deployment

    This tutorial uses the Foundry Keystore for increased security. You can optionally fill up your own wallet with sFUEL, and set the 
    private key in commands using --private key [your-private-key], however, this is not recommended.

    Start by creating a new keystore:

    ```shell
    cast wallet import skale-deployer --private-key $(cast wallet new | grep 'Private key:' | awk '{print $3}')
    ```

    <Aside type="note">
    Provide a password to encrypt the keystore file when running the above command.
    If you forget this password you will not be able to recover it and the SKALE team will not be able to help you recover it.
    </Aside>

    The above command:

    - Generates a new private key
    - Imports the private key into a keystore file named `skale-deployer`
    - Prints the address of the newly created wallet to the console

    You can reprint the address at any time using:

    ```shell
    cast wallet address --account skale-deployer
    ```

    Copy the address from your console and head over to the [sFUEL Station](https://sfuelstation). Input the address, toggle testnet, and fill up
    on Europa Testnet (the blue one).

    <Aside type="tip">
    Make sure you toggle testnet on first!
    </Aside>

7. ### Deploy the Smart Contract

    To deploy the `Counter.sol` smart contract, run the following and enter your keystore deployer password:

    ```shell
    forge create src/Counter.sol:Counter --account skale-deployer --rpc-url skale_testnet --broadcast --legacy
    ```

    A successful deployment should look something like this:

    ```shell
    Enter keystore password:
    Deployer: 0x63a38D694de837dDF765f9b2704814275586D812
    Deployed to: 0x4A435f6E471f773173774E860EBDcd17B132a2b4
    Transaction hash: 0x3f6cc66e860cb82a6a62e3f5181c401e5558d60d622a9157437002e16c1ce488
    ```
8. ### Verify your Smart Contract

    To verify your smart contract, run the following in your terminal:

    <Aside>
    Make sure you input the address of your deployed contract for [address]
    </Aside>

    ```shell
    forge verify-contract \
        --rpc-url skale_testnet \
        [address] \
        src/Counter.sol:Counter \
        --verifier blockscout \
        --verifier-url https://juicy-low-small-testnet.explorer.testnet.skalenodes.com/api
    ```

    <Aside type="note">
    The below prompt is a full example of the verification request and successful output!
    </Aside>
    ```shell
    # The following is an example of what the full verification request looks like
    forge verify-contract \
        --rpc-url skale_testnet \
        0x4A435f6E471f773173774E860EBDcd17B132a2b4 \
        src/Counter.sol:Counter \
        --verifier blockscout \
        --verifier-url https://juicy-low-small-testnet.explorer.testnet.skalenodes.com/api

    # Output
    Start verifying contract `0x4A435f6E471f773173774E860EBDcd17B132a2b4` deployed on 1444673419
    
    Contract [src/Counter.sol:Counter] "0x4A435f6E471f773173774E860EBDcd17B132a2b4" is already verified. Skipping verification.

    # You can validate the deployment here: https://juicy-low-small-testnet.explorer.testnet.skalenodes.com/address/0x4A435f6E471f773173774E860EBDcd17B132a2b4
    ```
</Steps>

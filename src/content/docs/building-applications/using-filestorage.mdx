SKALE Filestorage is the only onchain and decentralized filestorage in blockchain. The following walks through an example of how to use filestorage on your sChain.
Interested in learning more about filestorage first? Checkout the [How Filestorage Works page](/how-skale-works/filestroage). If you are a SKALE Chain Owner or Operator,
you can also see the [upgradeable contracts](/run-a-skale-chain/upgradeable-contracts) section to learn more about customizing your filestorage implementation.

## Preparing Files

The following example will be showcasing how to store a static website in filestorage.

## 1. Retrieve sChain Information
You will need:
- An RPC Endpoint
- A private key (with sFUEL) that has been provided with storage space
- Files (see next section)

## 2. Prepare Files

Anything that builds into HTML, CSS, JS, and media files will work. If you haven't already built a site, you can use the below:

<Code code={indexHtmlCode} lang="html" title="index.html" />
<Code code={stylesCssCode} lang="css" title="styles.css" />

### 3. Upload to your SKALE Chain

Setup your project as follows:
<Aside type="note">
The following assumes you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed on your machine and are using a Unix machine (or command prompt).
</Aside>

Run the following in your terminal:

```shell
mkdir skale-fs-website \
&& cd skale-fs-website \
&& npm init -y \
&& npm install @skalenetwork/filestorage.js dotenv \
&& touch index.js .env \
&& mkdir test-skale \
&& cd test-skale
```

If you are using your own static site, copy the site into the folder called `test-skale`. If you are using the example above,
run the following in your terminal:

```shell
touch index.html styles.css
```

Once complete, copy the above files into their respective files.

### 4. Setup

Open the `index.js` file and copy in the following:

<Code code={filestorageUploadCode} lang="js" title="index.js" />

Open the `.env` file and copy in the following:

```text
PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
RPC_URL=RPC_URL_OF_SKALE_CHAIN
```

### 5. Executing

When executing, this is done via the standard RPC_URL endpoint of your sChain. This was added to your `.env` file above.
To execute, run the following:

```shell
node index.js
```

Upon executing, [Filestorage.js](https://github.com/skalenetwork/filestorage.js) is taking the files and turning them into EVM chunks which are then sent as transactions
up to the SKALE Chain.

### 6. Access your website

If using the [SKALE Proxy](/run-a-skale-chain/schain-rpcs), the following is your endpoint:

```shell
# Reverse Proxy Endpoint = mainnet.skalenodes.com
# SKALE Chain Name = honorable-steel-rasalhague
# Filestorage Full Path = uploader address + path + file name + file extension 
# Example: https://network.skalenodes.com/fs/chubby-sadr/77333da3492c4BBB9ccf3Ea5bb63d6202f86cda8/index.html
http(s)://REVERSE_PROXY_ENDPOINT/fs/SKALE_CHAIN_NAME/[FILESTORAGE_FULL_PATH]
```

If connecting directly to a single node on the sChain, the following is your endpoint:

```shell
# Node Domain Name = validator.com
# SKALE Chain Name = elated-tan-skat
# Filestorage Full Path = uploader address + path + file name + file extension 
# Example: https://node1.validator.com/fluffy-marsupial/77333da3492c4BBB9ccf3Ea5bb63d6202f86cda8/index.html
http(s)://NODE_DOMAIN_NAME/SKALE_CHAIN_NAME/FILESTORAGE_FULL_PATH
```

<Aside type="note">
The uploader address in the URLs MUST omit the 0x prefix AND be in lowercase.
For example: 0x77333Da3492C4BBB9CCF3EA5BB63D6202F86CDA8 must be entered as 77333da3492c4BBB9ccf3Ea5bb63d6202f86cda8

This integration guide is for Wallets interested in integrating with the SKALE Network.
It contains a high-level introduction to SKALE, operational nuances, information on speed and costs, and RPC information.

If you require support, please reach out in the [SKALE Discord](https://discord.gg/skale).

## Intro to SKALE

SKALE is a network of interopable Layer 1 blockchains with leaderless consensus, instant finality, and zero gas fees.
Each SKALE Chain in the network is capable of 400+ TPS, single-slot finality, and is fully EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible.

To avoid having to source liquidity and operations on every single chain, the network utilizes **Hubs** to easily share resources between different chains.
The SKALE Europa Hub is used for a combination of DeFi, liquidity, and payment related operations and is the most common location for
centralized exchanges to setup. Exchanges are welcome to add support for any SKALE Chain directly.

### Operations

The network offers stable public proxy endpoints run by the core team (all actions redirect to validator nodes).
See the public RPC endpoints below that you can consume for free. If you would prefer a dedicated endpoint you can: 

1. Run your own [SKALE Proxy](/run-a-skale-chain/run-a-skale-proxy)
2. Contact the [Eidolon](https://eidolon.gg) team who can run dedicated proxy endpoints

If you require indexing or archival capabilities, please reach out to the core team in [Discord](https://discord.gg/skale).

### RPC Endpoints

The following are public RPC endpoints for for the four (4) SKALE Hubs:

### Speed &amp; Finality

SKALE is known for being incredibly fast.
It's very common for new infrastructure partners and exchanges to use "Ethereum or EVM Standards" for things like estimating block times,
number of confirmations/finality, etc.

**Key Information about SKALE**

| Key | Info |
| - | - |
| TPS* | 400 |
| Finality | 1 block/single slot |
| Avg. Block Time | 1 second |
| Forking | None -- only 1 block confirmation needed for receipt |

\* TPS is per chain

<Aside type="tip">
If you are sending many transactions rapid fire, you should manually increment nonces or use NonceManager on most SKALE Chains.
If you are using Calypso or Europa, note that these are non Multi-Transaction Mode chains and only one (1) transaction is allowed per wallet
per block.
</Aside>

### Gas Fees

The native gas token on a SKALE Chain is sFUEL. sFUEL has no monetary value which is how SKALE has zero gas fees.
You can either distribute sFUEL to users by requesting an allocation or the recommended option is to implement [gasless transactions](/building-applications/gasless-transactions).

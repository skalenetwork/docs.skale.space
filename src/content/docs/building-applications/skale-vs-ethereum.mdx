## Definitions

SKALE Network - a network of Layer 1 blockchains that are fully EVM compatible, built different to scale gaming, AI, DeFi, and more.
SKALE Chain - a singular Layer 1 within the SKALE Network. Often referred to as a mini Ethereum with superpowers.
Etheruem - the original programmable Layer 1 blockchain that is also the biggest in the world in terms of direct total value secured

### Gas Fees

Every SKALE Chain in the network has zero gas fees forever and always. While it is possible to introduce an
ecosystem token or fee token at the contract level; a SKALE Chain by default has zero gas fees and gasless transactions
enabled. This differs from Ethereum who uses a variable gas fee called Ether which users must acquire (generally through purchasing)
in order to execute transactions or developers who must use it to deploy smart contracts.

This gives SKALE a unique advantage that few other blockchains in the space can match from both an operational efficiency perspective and
from a user experience [and developer experience] perspective.

### Block Times

Block times on SKALE can vary depending on the chain load. The default empty block -- which is when a chain has no transactions -- 
on a SKALE Chain is 10 seconds. Under active load, SKALE Chains tend to operate with block times of 1-1.2 seconds on average with 
some chains doing subsecond blocks with sufficient validator hardware.

Ethereum has consistent 12 second block times meaning that it takes much longer for a transaction to be added to the blockchain especially
with dynamic gas pricing where short term gas spikes can result in a transaction taking multiple blocks to be profitable for a validator to add it in.

### Finality

Finality is the act of being permanent on a blockchain. Traditionally blockchains including Etheruem have had to deal with forking.
Forking brings about both short term UX negativity (i.e waiting for multiple block confirmations) as well potential MEV vulnerabilities such as tail-forking.

SKALE solves both the short term UX problem with single-slot finality, meaning after one block transaction state is fully final and cannot change.
Additionally, with leaderless consensus which enables unified validation paired with single-slot finality; tail-forking is not possible on SKALE 
simple and efficiently solivng one of the more complicated forms of MEV.

Ethereum on the other hand has a more complex form of finalization through [Gasper](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/gasper/).
In Gasper, finality requires a two-thirds (2/3) agreement that a block is canonical. To do so, blocks on Ethereum must pass through a two-step upgrade procedure
where: 

1. Two-thirds of the total staked ether must have voted in favor of a particular block being included in the canonical chain.
This upgrades a block to **justified** status. Blocks can revert in this stage.

2. When another block is **justified** on top of a **justified** block it is upgraded to **finalized**. Finalizing a block is a commitement to include
the block in the canonical chain. It cannot be reverted without an attacker spending (through destruction) millions of ether to do so.

The block upgrades do not happen in every slot, but instead occur only for epoch-boundry blocks. There is one block per slot on Ethereum
meaning one slot occurs every 12 seconds and each epoch is 32 slots. In order to full upgrade, a pair of checkpoints is viewed and should contain
a "supermajority link" where two successive checkpoints must exist. Two successive checkpoints would be two-thirds of the total staked ether voting
that checkpoint B is the correct descendant of checkpoint A).

With epochs being 32 slots, slots being 12 seconds, and two successful checkpoints required; this means that finality on Ethereum is not achievable
without >=12 minutes of operations, giving SKALE a significant advantage.

### Virtual Machine

Ethereum -- the pioneer of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) -- is the most well known Layer 1 blockchain in the world.
Many blockchain networks including SKALE have adopted the EVM in order to better cater toward the existing developer community.
SKALE's Ethereum Virtual Machine does have some small differences from Ethereum, but generally, most smart contracts should work right away on 
SKALE.

### Scaling the L1

SKALE and Ethereum are vastly different in how they scale.

Ethereum primarily makes use of Layer 2s who post transactions back to Ethereum primarily through blobs.
This creates further finality issues with most L2s having >60s plus finality back to the Layer 1 with potential reorganizations further down the road with
the long finality time of Ethereum itself.

SKALE on the other hand, which was originally a scaling solution for Ethereum scales through the interconnected blockchain model.
dApps that start on a shared SKALE Chain can easily migrate to their own SKALE Layer 1 chain and connect back to the first chain without an issue.

While Ethereum touts itself as the base settlement layer and leaves primary execution to L2s, SKALE enables developers to execute and settle in real-time all on the same
blockchain.

### Contract Code Size Limit

The contract code size limit is the amount of code that can be deployed in a single smart contract to the blockchain.
All of the common tips and tricks you can use on Ethereum such as using Libraries to reduce contract size are valid on SKALE.

The default contract size limit on SKALE Chains is 64kb compared to Ethereum's 24kb. The limit can be set higher on SKALE Chains, however, in most
cases it makes sense to start moving logic to libraries if contracts are that large.

### EIP-1559 Support
SKALE supports EIP-1559 at the network level. Gas has no value and therefore, the actual burning does not occur
and sFUEL is recycled to Etherbase, however, all wallets support EIP-1559 fully.

<Aside type="note">
The SKALE team is aware of EIP-1559 not fully working with Foundry. To use Foundry with a SKALE Chain,
add the `--legacy` flag.

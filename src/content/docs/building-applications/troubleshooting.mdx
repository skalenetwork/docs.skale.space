The following page is full of small nuances and issues that the SKALE team sees frequently along with
recommended solutions:

### Q: Why are transactions failing in Foundry?

When deploying a contract or running a script in Foundry, it's possible that the Type-2/EIP-1559 transaction can fail.
When this occurs, simply add the `--legacy` flag to your CLI command to resolve.

```shell
# Before [may fail]
forge create ./src/Counter.sol:Counter --private-key <pk> --rpc-url <rpc-url> --broadcast

# After
forge create ./src/Counter.sol:Counter --private-key <pk> --rpc-url <rpc-url> --broadcast --legacy
```

### Q: Why is my Foundry script failing on a SKALE Chain?

When executing a Foundry script using Forge on a SKALE Chain; it's possible that many function calls to the chain
can result in failure. With the EVM requiring sequential nocnes, without the `--slow` flag; it attempt to send multiple
transactions with the same nonce with results in failure.

```shell
# Before [may fail]
forge create ./src/Counter.sol:Counter --private-key <pk> --rpc-url <rpc-url> --broadcast

# After [recommended to add the legacy flag as well]
forge create ./src/Counter.sol:Counter --private-key <pk> --rpc-url <rpc-url> --broadcast --slow --legacy
```

### Q: Why isn't my smart contract working?

The most common issue related to smart contracts either failing to deploy OR reads/writes failing is
due to Solidity and VM compiler versions. SKALE runs a slightly modified version of the Ethereum Virtual Machine,
built in C++ to enable blazing fast performance, however this does mean that SKALE while EVM compatible is not 1:1 with
Ethereum itself.

To ensure that your contract is fully compatible with a SKALE Chain please ensure that you are:

- Using Solidity version \<=0.8.24
- Using EVM Compiler \<= Shanghai

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This integration guide is for Centralized Exchanges (CEX) interested in integrating with the SKALE Network.
It contains a high-level introduction to SKALE, operational nuances, information on speed and costs, and RPC information.

If you require support, please reach out in the [SKALE Discord](https://discord.gg/skale).

## Intro to SKALE

SKALE is a network of interopable Layer 1 blockchains with leaderless consensus, instant finality, and zero gas fees.
Each SKALE Chain in the network is capable of 400+ TPS, single-slot finality, and is fully EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible.

To avoid having to source liquidity and operations on every single chain, the network utilizes **Hubs** to easily share resources between different chains.
The SKALE Europa Hub is used for a combination of DeFi, liquidity, and payment related operations and is the most common location for
centralized exchanges to setup. Exchanges are welcome to add support for any SKALE Chain directly.

### Operations

Many CEX's prefer to run a node when integrating a new chain.
Due to SKALE's containerized architecture and unique pooled security model, every SKALE Chain currently runs on 16 nodes randomly allocated from
the pool of validator Supernodes. The network offers stable public proxy endpoints run by the core team (all actions redirect to validator nodes).
See the public RPC endpoints below that you can consume for free. If you would prefer a dedicated endpoint you can: 

1. Run your own [SKALE Proxy](/run-a-skale-chain/run-a-skale-proxy)
2. Contact the [Eidolon](https://eidolon.gg) team who can run dedicated proxy endpoints

If you require indexing or archival capabilities, please reach out to the core team in [Discord](https://discord.gg/skale).

### RPC Endpoints

The following are public RPC endpoints for for the four (4) SKALE Hubs:

| Chain Name | Category | RPC Endpoint |
| - | - | - |
| Calypso | Consumer, Social, DePIN | https://mainnet.skalenodes.com/v1/honorabl-steel-rasalhague |
| Europa (Recommended) | DeFi, Liquidity | https://mainnet.skalenodes.com/v1/elated-tan-skat |
| Nebula | Gaming | https://mainnet.skalenodes.com/v1/green-giddy-denebola |
| Titan | AI | https://mainnet.skalenodes.com/v1/parallel-stormy-spica |

### Block Explorers

| Chain Name | Category | Explorer URL |
| - | - | - |
| Calypso | Consumer, Social, DePIN | https://honorable-steel-rasalhague.explorer.mainnet.skalenodes.com |
| Europa (Recommended) | DeFi, Liquidity | https://elated-tan-skat.explorer.mainnet.skalenodes.com |
| Nebula | Gaming | https://green-giddy-denebola.explorer.mainnet.skalenodes.com |
| Titan | AI | https://parallel-stormy-spica.explorer.mainnet.skalenodes.com |

### Speed &amp; Finality

SKALE is known for being incredibly fast. It's very common for new infrastructure partners and exchanges to use "Ethereum or EVM Standards" for things like estimating block times, number of confirmations/finality, etc.

**Key Information about SKALE**

| Key | Info |
| - | - |
| TPS* | 400 |
| Finality | 1 block/single slot |
| Avg. Block Time | 1 second |
| Forking | None -- only 1 block confirmation needed for receipt |

\* TPS is per chain

### Gas Fees

The native gas token on a SKALE Chain is sFUEL. sFUEL has no monetary value which is how SKALE has zero gas fees.
You can acquire a small deposit of sFUEL from the [SKALE sFUEL Station](https://sfuelstation.com) for each of the four (4) core hubs. Exchanges are automatically eligible on SKALE Hubs to operate for free as long as they list an active token on the SKALE Chain. When adding support for a SKALE Chain, exchanges may contact the core team for support in attaining a larger deposit of sFUEL.

<Aside type="danger" title="Warning">You should NEVER list sFUEL as part of a trading pair or use it for trading</Aside>

### Tokens

Each of the SKALE Hubs is home to a variety of bridged and native tokens. This includes common staples like USDC, USDT, ETH, WBTC, and more to native tokens like Haven's Compass CMPS token, and of course the network's utility token, SKL.

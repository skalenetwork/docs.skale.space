## What is a SKALE Chain?

A SKALE Chain is a layer 1 blockchain running within the SKALE Network. It leverages the networks pool of validators for shared security,
has zero gas fees, single-slot finality, and is incredibly powerful. The truth is that not every developer or project needs their own blockchain.

SKALE offers both shared and dedicated compute option to developers, similar to most cloud providers. Analogous to a utility company, you have the
option to pick which makes the most sense for you.

### Shared Resources (a.k.a SKALE Hubs)

The SKALE Hub chains are ideal for most developers starting out. These chains consume a large portion of every SKALE Supernode, offer hundreds of transactions per second,
hundreds of gigabytes of decentralized storage, and can host hundreds if not thousands of applications operating in parallel.

The four (4) SKALE Hubs available today are:

- Calypso: Consumer, Social, DePIN
- Europa: DeFi & Liquidity
- Nebula: Gaming
- Titan: Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Machine Learning (ML)

Feel free to pick any of them when getting started on SKALE Testnet! If you are new to building on SKALE and aren't sure where to go
join us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/skale) and chat with the Developer Success team! Interested in running a hub for a specific niche?
Reach out to the SKALE team in [Discord](https://discord.gg/skale)!

### Dedicated Resources (a.k.a SKALE Appchain)

In addition to the four SKALE Hubs, the SKALE Network as a whole is home to many application specific layer 1 blockchains.
Each appchain is fully dedicated to an individual application (or a small subset if owned by a company or consortium). Appchains
within the SKALE Network can be multiple different sizes and have different configurations. Interested in your own appchain?

**Important Notes on Appchains**
- New SKALE Appchains are a mostly blank slate, they do not come with anything except: Native Bridge, Native RNG, Native Filestorage (optional), Native Oracle, and the chain itself.
- You can connect to other hub chains to access liquidity and key partners
- All sChains are by default connected to Ethereum with the native bridge as well
- Once your chain is up and running, your chain must stay up to date on [payments](/run-a-skale-chain/pricing-and-payments) in order to stay alive. Chains
that are >3 months overdue on payments may be eligible for deletion

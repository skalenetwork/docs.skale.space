SKALE's Interchain Messaging Agent (IMA) Bridge allows for direct communication and bridging between SKALE Chains (without ever going to Mainnet).

The following walks you through setting up an ERC-1155 token between two SKALE Chains and how to programatically bridge.

## Important Information
- When a SKALE Chain is created, there are no ERC-1155 tokens mapped by default
- A token being bridged between two chains should have its supply **issued** (i.e minted) on one chain. The second SKALE Chain mints by design via IMA, however, the token should not be mintable any other way
- Tokens being bridged from SKALE Chain to SKALE Chain are locked in TokenManagerERC1155 on the origin chain
- Tokens being bridged from SKALE Chain to SKALE Chain are minted by IMA on the destination chain

## Bridge Setup

<Aside type="note">
If the SKALE Chains you are mapping the ERC-1155 token from/to are not connected, please [connect the SKALE Chains](/skale-bridge/skale/connect-schains).
</Aside>

### 1. Prepare the ERC-1155

ERC-1155 tokens that are being bridged between SKALE Chains should have the **mint** function that is locked down to TokenManagerERC1155. 

<Aside type="danger" title="Caution on Minting">
If the mint function is not locked down to just the IMA Bridge, specifically TokenManagerERC1155; there is a chance that the existing tokens on the SKALE Chain may not match what is secured in the bridge.
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution" title="Caution on Burning">
If the burn function is not locked down to just the IMA Bridge, specifically TokenManagerERC1155; there is a chance that the supply on the SKALE Chain side could be "burned", while the tokens still exist on the original SKALE Chain which could later be withdrawn under certain circumstances. It is recommended that explicit burns on a SKALE Chain should be avoided for bridged tokens.
</Aside>

The following is the base interchain token code that meets the above bridging requirements for IMA. It is not recommended to use this directly, but to use a wrapper. See **YourInterchainNFT.sol** for an example.

<Code code={InterchainERC1155Code} lang="solidity" title="InterchainERC1155.sol" />
### 2. Deploy the ERC-1155 on SKALE

Utilize your preferred tooling i.e [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh), [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org), [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#lang=en&optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=paris&version=soljson-v0.8.19+commit.7dd6d404.js), etc. to deploy your IMA compatible ERC-1155 token to the SKALE Chain you want to be able to bridge assets too.

<Code code={InGameTokensCode} lang="solidity" title="InGameTokens.sol" />

> *InterchainERC1155.sol is inherited from the code above*

### 3. Map the SKALE Token

<Aside type="note">
If you are trying to setup a token on SKALE in a production environment please join us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/skale) for support!
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">
Make sure to replace the values with your SKALE Chain name and the correct token addresses.
</Aside>

#### Add the token on SKALE Chain TokenManagerERC1155
- **DST_SCHAIN_NAME** is the name of the sChain that the transaction should execute on
- **ORIGIN_SCHAIN_NAME** is the name of the sChain that the token is being mapped from
- **0x_ORIGIN_TOKEN** is the original token address on the ORIGIN_SCHAIN_NAME
- **0x_DST_TOKEN** is the destination token address on the DST_SCHAIN_NAME

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Multisigwallet CLI">
    ```shell
    npx msig encodeData [DST_SCHAIN_NAME] TokenManagerERC1155 addERC20TokenByOwner [ORIGIN_SCHAIN_NAME] [0x_ORIGIN_TOKEN] [0x_DST_TOKEN]
    ```
    After this, execute by following the steps on [Using SAFE](/run-a-skale-chain/using-safe#submit-transaction-to-safe)
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Verify the Mapping

To verify the mapping, you should have an event emitted from TokenManagerERC1155 on SKALE Chain - `event ERC1155TokenAdded(SchainHash indexed chainHash, address indexed erc1155OnMainChain, address indexed erc1155OnSchain);`

## Bridging ERC-1155

The following does not require you to setup your own token. This works with **ANY** ERC-1155 token that is mapped from a SKALE Chain to any other SKALE Chain as long as the actual ERC-1155 token on each side does not have additional restrictions around who can transfer.

The flow for bridging an ERC-1155 from sChain to sChain follows a very similar flow to a standard ERC-1155 transfer:

1. Approve the bridge contract on the ERC-1155 token to allow it to move your NFTs
2. Call the bridge directly to transfer the specific ERC-1155 from SKALE Chain -> SKALE Chain, if the mapping exists
3. Wait for the message to be posted by the validator set on the SKALE Chain, which is the net-new minted NFT corresponding to the NFT (by id) locked on the origin SKALE Chain during the bridge

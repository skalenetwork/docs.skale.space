> **Transform your blockchain experience with SKALE's revolutionary bridging and messaging technology**

Welcome to the future of blockchain interoperability! SKALE's Interchain Messaging Agent (IMA) provides the most advanced, secure, and cost-effective solution for moving assets between Ethereum and SKALE chains.

## Why Choose SKALE Bridge?

### **Zero Gas Fees** 
Say goodbye to expensive transaction costs. Bridge your assets and transact freely without worrying about gas fees eating into your profits when bridging SKALE Chain to SKALE Chain.

<Aside type="note">
Bridging to or from Ethereum? Just pay the ETH gas fees.
</Aside>

### **Instant Finality**
Experience lightning-fast transactions with thanks to SKALE's incredibly fast block times averaging ~1 second. Most messages and bridging transactions deliver in less than 30 seconds!

### **Decentralized Security**
SKALE boasts one of the **ONLY** native bridges that is truly decentralized. IMA directly leverages the validators, threshold encryption design, and supermajority requirements that make SKALE Consensus so fast and secure.

### **Full EVM Compatibility**
Seamlessly migrate your existing Ethereum applications without code changes while gaining massive performance improvements PLUS bring your tokens and NFTs!

## What is IMA? 

SKALE's Interchain Messaging Agent (IMA) is a decentralized, high-performance message transport layer and bridging protocol.
The unique design and flexiblity of IMA allows every SKALE Chain to be joined together into an interconnected web of blockchains that make up the SKALE Network. For more information on how IMA is designed, head over to [IMA Architecture](/skale-bridge/ima-architecture).

title: SKALE Validators
description: Overview of the SKALE Network Validators
---

SKALE is a network of Layer-1 blockchains which have zero gas fees, infinite scalability,
and are built for best-in-class UX.

SKALE is unique from other blockchain networks. The SKALE Network has a pool of validators that work together
to secure the network. These validators provide computation power to the SKALE Network by deploying SKALE Nodes.
The collection of validators and the node(s) they spin up represent the entire validator network that performs
work for SKALE Chains (a Layer-1 Ethereum Compatible Chain). Each SKALE Chain in the network is operated by a
group of virtualized sub-nodes selected from a subset of the nodes run by validators in the SKALE network and
are run on all or a subset [multi-tenancy] of each node’s computation and storage resources.

As each node in the network continues to participate in their assigned SKALE Chains, they are awarded
bounties based on their performance at the end of each network epoch. Each node is monitored by their peer
nodes. When a SKALE Chain has reached the end of its lifetime, the resources (computation, storage) of its
virtualized sub-nodes will be freed so that validator nodes may participate in newly created SKALE Chains.

Validator nodes also receive direct payment from SKALE Chain pricing, which is "rent" paid by the chain owners/operators
for this compute.

## Expectations

- Reliable connection to SKALE Network (low latency, high uptime)
- Robust security practices and network architecture
- Running the latest SKALE Node software releases
- Participation in governance (when applicable)

To encourage proper behavior among network participants, SKALE follows a Proof of Stake (PoS) system whereby each node must
stake a predetermined amount of SKALE tokens to be slashed at the citation of any activity not condoned by the network.

Activities not approved by the network include those which denote a failure to properly participate in each assigned SKALE
Chain’s consensus, and maintain uptime and latency standards enforced by the Service Level Agreement (SLA).

Network SLAs are enforced through an algorithmic peer review system whereby each node is appointed 24 node peers to
monitor and log their network participation, uptime, and latency. These metrics will be collected and averaged on the
Ethereum mainnet to reward or slash nodes according to their respective performance.

## Requirements

To be added as a node to the SKALE Network, a prospective node must run the SKALE Admin, which manages all operations in the node and is
installed with the [skale-node-cli](/ecosystem/validators/validator-cli). SKALE Admin evaluates the prospective node to ensure that it's upholding
network hardware requirements. If the prospective node passes this verification step, the SKALE Admin permits the node to submit a request
to SKALE Manager to join the network. This request contains both the required network deposit as well as node metadata collected by the
SKALE Daemon (for example IP address, port, public key, etc.).

Once the request has been submitted to SKALE Manager on Ethereum, SKALE Manager randomly defines the prospective node as a 'full node' or
a 'fractional node' by assigning different sizes of SKALE Chains to the prospective node. Full nodes have all their resources utilized
for a single SKALE Chain, while fractional nodes participate in multiple SKALE Chains (multi-tenancy).

### General Hardware Requirements

**Important notes:**

If you have any issues, you can save the logs using the `skale logs dump` command. It's also useful to check logs from node-cli using `skale cli logs`
from the docker plugin at `/var/log/docker-lvmpy/lvmpy.log` if there are any issues.

### Block Storage

Docker has an easy way of limiting other machine resources such as CPU, memory, and volume. These resources are configurable through
[the docker setup](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/?source=post_page-----9859682f4147----------------------).
Configuring machine resources such as CPU and memory is easy to complete via the docker setup; however, configuring volume requires a few more steps.

To assist with configuring volume, SKALE Labs introduced [docker-lvmpy](https://github.com/skalenetwork/docker-lvmpy), a simple volume driver
for Logical Volume Manager (LVM) volumes written in Python to format and partition disk space per SKALE Chain.

When a validator sets up a node through the CLI, SKALE Admin calls docker-lvmpy to format the external and unmounted volume. Each validator in the SKALE Network must provide a non-boot external disk space, which will be used to partition the volume by the SKALE Admin.

SKALE Admin calls docker-lvmpy to limit disk space per container (for example, 20GB) and splits the volume into 1/128 size partitions.
Once LVM splits the container and allocates the new space to the SKALE Chain, docker-lvmpy informs SKALE Admin that the disk is limited based
on the configured SKALE Chain size.

### SGX (HSM)

Software Guard Extension (SGX) is an Intel® technology coprocessor ledger used for memory encryption and increasing the security of application code
by storing encrypted data in the processor.

A SKALE sub-node connects to the SGX wallet server, and then the SGX wallet connects to the wallet enclave (BLS signatures and ETH keys). Keys
stored in the processor can't be taken out, and they can only be encrypted or decrypted through the enclave. The key within the processor is secure
in the enclave, and hackers can't hack the enclave and receive the key.

Without SGX, human confirmation is necessary for transactions made in the SKALE Network. SKALE uses SGX for securing cryptographic keys by allowing
nodes to connect hardware wallets without human interaction.

SKALE uses BLS to sign blocks in consensus, and ECDSA is needed to validate regular Ethereum transactions. SKALE will have a separate
wallet integration for ECDSA. SKALE will use Intel® SGX technology to store BLS signatures at the coprocessor level and let users automatically
authorize transactions. Currently, other than bare-metal servers, SGX is supported for these cloud providers:

- [Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/108507.html?spm=a2c5t.10695662.1996646101.searchclickresult.84d1a80dPBX0Di)
- [Equinix](https://www.equinix.com/services/edge-services/smartkey/)
- [IBM Cloud Data Guard](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/data-use-protection-ibm-cloud-using-intel-sgx?mhsrc=ibmsearch_a&mhq=sgx)
- [Microsoft Azure](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/software-guard-extensions/microsoft-confidential-computing-sgx-video.html)

(HSMs) Ledger Nano, or Trezor can support ECDSA signatures but not BLS signatures at this time, which are used by SKALE Consensus.

**Advantages of SGX Wallet**

- Helps developers protect sensitive data
- Programmable for advanced crypto, such as BLS signatures
- Doesn't require validators to continually confirm transactions
- All SKALE crypto (BLS/DKG) can be done through the SGX wallet

SKALE will have two types of SGX operations:

- **Local (Secure)**: Wallet running on the same server as the sub-node
- **Network**: Sub-node talks to the SGX wallet over the SKALE Network. The validator is responsible for securing the connection.

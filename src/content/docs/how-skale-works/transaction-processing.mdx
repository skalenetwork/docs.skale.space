SKALE Chains can be created with either default processing or MTM mode. Interested in MTM mode on your SKALE Chain? Contact the team in [Discord](https://discord.gg/skale).

## Default Processing

SKALE Chains without multi-transaction mode allow the virtual machine to process one transaction per account per block ensuring that every transaction per account is fully **mined** before being added to the block and the chain.

This is similar to how Ethereum operates where an active transaction must be fully confirmed before the next transaction can be "mined" by the chain.


## Multi-Transaction Mode

Multi-transaction mode (MTM) is a configurable option for a SKALE Chain that allows the virtual machine to process multiple transactions from a single account in a single block.

This differs from default processing which only allows one transaction per account per block.

### How it Works

Multi-transaction mode adds a future transactions queue (FTQ) to skaled. Transactions are processed according to the following rules:

- if `transaction_nonce > current_nonce` then the transaction will be placed in FTQ (without MTM mode this transaction is discarded)

- once the transaction with `current_nonce` is imported to the transaction queue (TQ) and FTQ includes a batch of `k` transactions with a contigous range of nonces `[current_nonce+k, ..., current_nonce+2, current_nonce+1]` these transations will be imported to TQ from FTQ and will be processed as common transactions

<Aside type="note">
To protect skaled from memory overflow issues, the FTQ limits the amount of transactions inside. The default is **16384**. The oldest transactions are removed from the FTQ first if this limit is exceeded.

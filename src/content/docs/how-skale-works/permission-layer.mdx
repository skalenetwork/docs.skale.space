When deploying smart contracts on a SKALE Chain, developers have to be aware of the contract permission layer.

The permission layer of a SKALE Chain works within a very simple set of rules. Each rule list below covers the role underneath it:

1. The permission layer can be disabled, in which anyone can deploy anything.
2. The <span style="color: var(--sl-color-accent-high);">tx.origin</span> (i.e the sender) of the transaction MUST BE approved to deploy
3. A <span style="color: var(--sl-color-accent-high);">factory</span> smart contract can be approved directly to allow ANYONE to deploy
4. A <span style="color: var(--sl-color-accent-high);">factory</span> smart contract can be approved to allow ONLY specific addresses to deploy through it

### Option 1: Disabling the Permission Layer

If the deployer permission layer is disabled, you can proceed with deploying your smart contract as you would on any other EVM-compatible blockchain.

<Aside type="danger">
The SKALE Chain permission layer is enabled by default. Disabling the permission layer is not recommended for production chains, however, it is disabled by default
on SKALE Testnets.

### Option 2: Direct Approval

This is the most common route to deploy a smart contract on a SKALE Chain. When the above permission layer is enabled, being approved directly by
a chain operator enables you to deploy smart contracts.

<Aside type="note">
Deployment access on shared chains is generally revoked periodically to maintain a higher level of security on the chain.
</Aside>

### Option 3: Factory Approval

While rare, this functionality is used by developers to allow smart contracts to be deployed by anyone through another smart contract.
To allow this functionality, smart contracts should have their own checks that are verified by the chain operators to ensure they cannot be openly
bypass by any developer for "generic contract creation".

<Aside type="caution">
Generic contract creation should be protected against at all costs
</Aside>

### Option 4: Factory Allowlist

This is a pattern commonly used with account abstraction. It allows a specific set of wallets to be added to an allow list that can deploy through a specific factory contract
without giving them permission to deploy directly. This locks down their deployment capabilities to just what the factroy contract allows.

<Aside type="caution">
Allowlist wallets should be monitored to ensure they are not compromised.

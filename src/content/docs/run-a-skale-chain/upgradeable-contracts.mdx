SKALE Chains come with a number of predeployed smart contracts. These contracts can be upgraded independently on each and every SKALE Chain to allow
for maximum customization. The upgradeable predeployed contracts on SKALE use OpenZeppelin's Upgrade framework.

## Predeployed Architecture

- **Proxy Admin**: The contract managed by the sChain Owner directly that upgrades are executed through
- **Proxy Contract**: The proxy that redirects to the active underlying implementation
- **Implementation**: The contract with the active set of functions

## Upgrade Procedure

1. Deploy new **Implementation** contract on your sChain.

<Aside type="tip">
This can be done by any wallet with permission to deploy
</Aside>

2. Send upgrade transaction to the predeployed Proxy Admin for this contract

<Aside type="note">
This is done by the SKALE Chain owner. It can be executed from either the sChain multisig wallet OR the sChain Owner on the Ethereum Mainnet.
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">
Each set of predeploys has its own Proxy Admin, but all IMA predeploys share a Proxy Admin contract.
</Aside>

3. ProxyAdmin calls the predeployed Proxy contract and passes the new **implementation** address.

4. The proxy now points to the new **implementation**.

5. Upgrade complete!

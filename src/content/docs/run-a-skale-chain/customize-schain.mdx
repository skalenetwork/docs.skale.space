## State Configuration

One of the most important decisions made when creating a new SKALE Chain is where the state is going to be allocated.
There are three areas that node storage is allocatable too:

1. **Consensus Database**: the area of the node responsible for storing block data
2. **Contract Storage**: the area of the node that stores active contract state
3. **Filestorage**: the area of the node responsible for storing files uploaded or replicated via SKALE Filestorage

The following configurations are available:

{/* <!-- TODO need full list of configuration options w/ graphics --> */}
{/* <!-- Max State: 90% contract, 10% consensus, max filestorage: 80% filestorage, 10% state, 10% consensus, max consensus: 90% consensus, 10% state, default: 33% each --> */}

## Config Controller Configurations

SKALE Chains have two options when it comes to transaction processing.

- **Standard Processing**: allows for a single transaction per wallet per block. Great for chains interested in more robust protections
- **Multi-transaction Mode**: great for chains catering to high-throughput applications

See [transaction processing](/how-skale-works/transaction-processing) for more.

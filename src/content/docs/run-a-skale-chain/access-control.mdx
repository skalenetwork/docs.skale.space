title: Access Control
description: Managing Control and Access to a SKALE Chain
---

import { Aside, Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

While SKALE Chains themselves are Layer 1 blockchains, the architectural design intentionally allows for a semi-permissioned access control layer that is manageable by the chain owners or operators. This allows for maximum flexibility where an individual chain can be locked down to only allow a single application or group of applications to deploy, be 100% public for anyone, or allow various factories to be used by different wallets.

Access Control to a SKALE Chain is managed by the Config Controller smart contract which is predeployed on a SKALE Chain. Config Controller makes use of [OpenZeppellin's Access Control](https://openzeppelin.com) to handle roles, events, and management automatically.


<Aside type="note">
If you encouter the error **Out of Gas** when trying to deploy a smart contract to a SKALE Chain; this likely means that the address is not allowed to deploy smart contracts and is missing deployer access. See [whitelisting an address](#whitelist).
</Aside>

## Access via Accounts

The most straightforward and common way to access a SKALE Chain for deployment is by having an externally owned account (EOA) added to the chain allow list. An account that is added to this list is given `DEPLOYER_ROLE` which allows it to directly bypass all restrictions and deploy ANY smart contract to a SKALE Chain as long as it fits within the block gas limit.

See [how to add address to whitelist](#add-to-whitelist) and [how to remove from whitelist](#remove-from-whitelist) to understand how to manage your access control layer.

<Aside type="note">
DEPLOYER_ROLE is the most elevated deployer permission available for a chain with the permission layer enabled. Deployer Role allows deployment directly and through factories.
</Aside>

## Access via Factories

Another common method for deployment is via factories.

SKALE Chain owners and operators can deploy popular generic factories such as CREATE2Factory, SingletonFactory, and CreateX to their chain and allow developers to use them when deploying to their chain.

Additionally, developers themselves can create contracts to deploy other contracts making specific factories for their uses.

### Open Factory Usage

Open factory usage is where the SKALE Chain owner or operator grants `DEPLOYER_ROLE` to a smart contract that is acting as the factory. This then allows ANY account or smart to use the whitelisted factory to deploy a smart contract through.

**Example: SushiSwap**
On the [SKALE Europa Hub](https://portal.skale.space/chains/europa), SushiSwap which is based off of Uniswap; has a factory contract that creates liquidity pairs. This contract is dedicated to SushiSwap and allows for liquidity pairs (which are smart contracts) to be created by anyone via the UniswapV2/V3 factories that are deployed as part of SushiSwap's core architecture.

<Aside type="danger">
Open factory usage is generally not recommended on a SKALE Chain with zero gas, however, is necessary and even useful in some cases. Generic factories should not be opened up for public usage on a sChain with the permission layer enabled and zero gas fees to avoid spam.
</Aside>

This then allows anyone to deploy a smart contract via the factory regardless of their direct status on the allow list.

### Closed Factory Usage

Closed factory usage is where the SKALE Chain owner or operator allows a specific account or set of accounts to deploy through a factory.

The unique part about this design is:

1. The accounts whitelisted on the specific factory **DO NOT** have the ability to deploy directly to the blockchain or through other factories

2. Accounts provided with `DEPLOYER_ROLE` generally on the blockchain can deploy via the contract IF the contract allows generic deployment rights

3. Accounts without `DEPLOYER_ROLE` cannot deploy through the factory IF the factory does not have `DEPLOYER_ROLE` directly; sufficiently securing the contract and chain from spam

## Public Access

SKALE Chains by default come with the permission layer enabled. However, the permission layer can be enabled/disabled at any time by the SKALE Chain owner or operator. You can enable and disable the permission layer through the Config Controller smart contract.

### Add to Whitelist

The following is how to add an address to the SKALE Chain whitelist:

title: Managing sFUEL Distribution
description: Options for distributing sFUEL to developers and users of your SKALE Chain

import { Aside, Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

The default gas token of a SKALE Chain is SKALE Fuel (sFUEL). This gas token allows for a SKALE Chains to be fully Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible while also offering [zero gas fees](/building-applications/zero-gas-fees) to developers and end-users. While [gasless transactions](/building-applications/gasless-transactions) are recommended for most applications due to simple management; SKALE Chains running with sFUEL active will need to ensure developers and/or end-users can access the gas token to execute transactions.

## Etherbase

For SKALE Chain owners and operators, accessing sufficient sFUEL is critical.
All SKALE Chains come predeployed with a smart contract called **Etherbase** which is important for two reasons:

1. A large allocation of sFUEL is stored in this contract upon creation of the SKALE Chain, ensuring sufficient quantities are available for operators

2. sFUEL when consuemd in a transaction is automatically recycled into Etherbase ensuring that a SKALE Chain doesn't run out of gas

	<TabItem label="Ethers v6">
	```ts
	 // Using Ethers v6
	import { Contract, JsonRpcProvider, Wallet, parseEther } from "ethers";

	const ETHERBASE_ABI = [
		"function partiallyRetrieve(address payable receiver, uint256 amount) external",
	];

	const ETHERBASE_PREDEPLOYED_ADDRESS = "0xd2bA3e0000000000000000000000000000000000";
	
	async function main() {	
		const provider = new JsonRpcProvider("https://mainnet.skalenodes.com/v1/<schain-name>");
		const wallet = new Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, provider);
		const contract = new Contract(ETHERBASE_PREDEPLOYED_ADDRESS, ETHERBASE_ABI, wallet);
			
		// Allow anyone to deploy
		const res = await contract.partiallyRetrieve(wallet.address, parseEther("25"));

		console.log("Res: ", res); // Transaction Hash, once confirmed wallet.address native balance increases by 25
	}

	main()
		.catch((err) => {
			console.error(err);
			process.exitCode = 1;
		});
	```

</Tabs>

<Aside type="note">
If you encouter any errors when trying to retrieve gas from Etherbase; this likely means that the address is missing `ETHER_MANAGER_ROLE`.

## sFUEL Station

SKALE Chains can request being added to the [sFUEL Station](https://sfuelstation.com). The sFUEL Station is currently availalable on SKALE Hub testnet and mainnet Chains: Calypso, Europa, Nebula, and Titan. The sFUEL Station allows users to put in their wallet and attain a small allocation of sFUEL to get started on a particular sChain.

<Aside type="note">
While your chain may be added to the sFUEL Station upon request, this should not be a primary way to onboard users as it can increase the complexity of onboarding. You should utilize sFUEL Distribution within dApps when possible.

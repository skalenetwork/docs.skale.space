:::note
When bridging ETH from Base Sepolia to the SKALE Chain, the ETH is locked as native ETH (msg.value) and is minted as an ERC-20 called ETHC on the SKALE Chain.
On the frontend you can show it as ETH.
:::

:::note
WETH and ETHC are both ERC-20 on the SKALE Chain but are deposited differently. WETH is deposited as WETH on Base.

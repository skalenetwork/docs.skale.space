The go-live process for SKALE is unique compared to other EVM networks.
As SKALE Chains are permissioned, you must be given to permission by a chain owner or operator to deploy.
While all chains can have their own individual requirements; the below are the common checks that the majority
of the SKALE Chains use including the core SKALE Hubs: Calypso, Europa, Nebula, and Titan.

<Steps>

1. ### Onboarding Form

   Please fill out the onboarding form to help provide key information that will be used throughout the review process.

2. ### Validate your Smart Contracts

   #### Taking Payment/Valued Tokens

   SKALE is well known for its zero-gas fees. However, because the native 
   gas token sFUEL has no monetary value; it should never be used in situations where
   you are attempting to represent value.

   This means that in Solidity you should NOT use msg.value and should instead utilize tokens of value in the 
   form of ERC-20 or some other way to represent value. 

   For more information please check the [payments section](/building-applications/payments-on-skale).

   #### Check for Factories

   As mentioned above, SKALE Chains are permissioned by default.
   This permission layer on SKALE offers very explicit rules for how it operates:

   - It allows Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) -- e.g. private keys -- to deploy smart contracts IF
   they have the DEPLOYER_ROLE on the ConfigController.

   - It allows smart contracts to deploy other smart contracts without any sort of restrictions -- e.g factories.

   In order to ensure that the SKALE Chain you are looking to deploy to stays secure, the chain owners and operators 
   will request that your scripts and smart contracts only use contract factories that adhere to the following:

      - The use of deterministic deployers, e.g <a href="https://github.com/Arachnid/deterministic-deployment-proxy">CREATE2Factory</a>, should be swapped out for <a href="https://github.com/payvint/skale-deterministic-deployment-proxy">SKALE Deterministic Deploy</a>.
      - The use of contract creation factories for items like assets should ideally be locked down behind either authoritative actions/roles or limited in some other way. This
      will reduce the chance of a factory contract being botted with zero gas fees.

    For more information please check the [factories section](/building-applications/using-contract-factories).


3. ### Deploy to Testnet

   While individual dApp chains don't hold this requirement, if you plan on deploying to a SKALE Hub you should plan on showcasing your project on 
   testnet before requesting access to Mainnet. This will ensure that the chain operators have a chance to work with you to ensure that
   the chain you are looking to deploy on is the correct fit.

   You can find inforamtion about the different SKALE Chains Tesnets [here](/welcome/chain-info).

4. ### Showcase your Project

   Once you are ready to go to Mainnet, head over to the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/gM5XBy6">Discord</a> and add your project in
   the #showcase-your-project.

5. ### Request Review

   Please add the **Request Review** tag the SKALE Developer Success Team or the Chain Operator to proceed with the review process.

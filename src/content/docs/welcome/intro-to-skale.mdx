## Q: What is SKALE?

SKALE is a network of Layer 1 blockchains called SKALE Chains.
Every SKALE Chain operates independently and can be compared to a mini Ethereum, while still
leveraging the shared security of the broader SKALE Network.

## Q: Why does SKALE exist?

SKALE was created to solve the scalability and usability issues of Ethereum. Over the past 5 years
it has evolved into one of the few truly innovative blockchains in the world and is home to hundreds of builders
interested in leveraging decentralized technology without being limited by gas fees, slow transaction times, congestion, and 
archaic user experiences.

## Q: Is SKALE a Layer 1, Layer 2, or Layer 3?

Every SKALE Chain is a Layer 1 blockchain. SKALE is not a Layer 2 or Layer 3 solution.
SKALE Manager -- the brain of SKALE -- does live on the Ethereum mainnet today, however, each and every
SKALE Chain maintains its own state independently of Ethereum and leverages the SKALE shared validator pool, not Ethereum validators.

> SKALE is not a rollup, sidechain, or state channel solution. Every SKALE Chain maintains its own local ledger across a subset of SKALE Nodes.

## Q: How are there zero gas fees?

The SKALE Network -- which is governed by the SKALE DAO -- has a blockchain-as-a-service style fee structure in place.
SKALE Chain Owners are in charge of paying into the SKALE Network for their SKALE Chain each month in a process similar to "rent".
This fee structure is designed to be predictable and transparent while also being as stable as possible to ensure that chain owners can plan for the future while
taking advantage of superior unit economics in the short term.

## Q: What is the SKL token used for?

The SKL token is the utility token of the SKALE Network. It is used for:

| Use Case | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Staking | SKL is staked by validators to create nodes and secure the network |
| Bounties | SKL is rewarded back to validators each month in the form of bounties |
| Payment | SKL is used to pay for SKALE Chain on the Europa Hub |
| Governance | SKL is used to calculate voting power and meter proposal creation in the SKALE DAO |

## Q: Is SKALE EVM compatible?

Yes, SKALE Chains are EVM compatible. This means that developers can deploy their Solidity smart contracts to
SKALE Chains with little to no modification. SKALE Chains are also compatible with the vast majority of Ethereum tooling and infrastructure such as
[Foundry](https://foundry.sh), [MetaMask](https://metamask.io), [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org), and more!

<Aside type="caution">
Please note that SKALE Chains are not 100% compatible with Ethereum. There are some differences in the way that SKALE Chains operate
with the zero gas fee model as well as other operational pieces of Ethereum that do not make sense on SKALE. For the full comparision,
checkout the [SKALE vs Ethereum](/building-applications/skale-vs-ethereum) page.

## Q: Is there a main "SKALE chain"?

No, there is no main "SKALE chain". Every SKALE Chain is independent and operates on its own. The SKALE Network is a collection of many chains.
If you are a user looking to start using SKALE, head over to the [Getting Started](https://skale.space/get-started-on-skale) page on the SKALE website.
If you are a developer looking to start building on SKALE, head over to the [Pick a Chain](/building-applications/pick-a-chain) page in the docs for a deeper dive
into the different chains available.

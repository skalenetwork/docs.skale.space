Operators can reserve space for other addresses.

## Multisig Wallet

The Multisig Wallet is a pre-deployed multisignature wallet.
This is the original [Gnosis MultisigWallet](https://github.com/gnosis/MultiSigWallet) contract that is deployed by
default on all SKALE Chains. This contract allows the SKALE Chain owner to control
Marionette on the SKALE Chain side, a.k.a with zero gas fees.

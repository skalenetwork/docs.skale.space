import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

SKALE Network uses a native messaging and bridging protocol called **Interchain Messaging Agent (IMA)**. IMA connects every **SKALE Chain** to the **Ethereum Mainnet** and to other **SKALE Chains**. 

It is a modular system that allows transferring any type of data between chains (**Ethereum** ↔ **SKALE** or **SKALE** ↔ **SKALE**). Additionally, it includes prebuilt modules for moving tokens that follow popular ERC standards.

## Relation to Ethereum

IMA is backed by Ethereum mainnet and SKALE Chain security mechanisms - It uses your SKALE Chain’s
16 randomly selected validator nodes to sign and verify messages between the Ethereum mainnet and your
SKALE Chain using BLS threshold signatures and Trusted-Execution Environments (TEE). It uses smart contracts
running on Ethereum to manage the locking and unlocking of the deposit box on the mainnet. And, each of the
16 nodes supporting your SKALE Chain each has 20 million SKL tokens staked.

## Design Overview

IMA has **two main layers**:

1. **Messaging Protocol:** base layer that allows arbitrary data transfer between Ethereum and SKALE Chains. It uses two key contracts:
   - **MessageProxy:** contract on Ethereum Mainnet
   - **MessageProxyForSchain:** contract on each SKALE Chain  
    <Aside>This message exgange it's possible through SKALE Supernodes that run an IMA Agent software to listen for and forward messages to the target chain.</Aside>

2. **Bridging System:** layer built on top of the messaging protocol and handles token transfers. IMA includes default bridges for ERC-20, ERC-721 and ERC-1155 using the following contracts:
   - **Deposit Box:** contract on Ethereum Mainnet
   - **Token Manager:** contract on each SKALE Chain

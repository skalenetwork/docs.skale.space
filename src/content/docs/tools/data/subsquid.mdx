Subsquid is like an ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) tool.

Developers can use Subsquid to extract SKALE chain data and process EVM logs in one project and serve this data on a GraphQL endpoint.

Currently, Subsquid is available on the following SKALE chains:

| Mainnet Endpoints | Endpoint lookup cmd | Archive Endpoint |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| SKALE Nebula Hub | `lookupArchive('skale-nebula')` | `https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/skale-nebula` |

Meson can be integrated in three different ways in an application:

- **Link**: This method requires merely adding a link. A popup window will then guide the user to complete the cross-chain transfer. Link integration is a fast and easy way to integrate Meson, ideal for platforms wanting a quick setup to leverage Meson's cross-chain capabilities.

- **SDK**: For a more seamless user experience, you can install the meson.to SDK. Beyond the features of Link integration, SDK integration displays your app name & icon, and enables direct interaction with your app's smart contract during a cross-chain transfer.

- **API**: If you prefer backend integration, you can directly use the Meson protocol through APIs.

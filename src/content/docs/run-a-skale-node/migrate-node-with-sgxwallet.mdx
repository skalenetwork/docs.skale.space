import { Aside, Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

This guide provides instructions for migrating a SKALE node and SGXWallet to a new server following the recommended migration process.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the migration, ensure you have:

- Access to both the current and new servers
- Administrative privileges on both systems
- Secure network connection between servers

   <Aside type="caution" title="Important">
     Make sure backup is created before starting migration. You can use the `skale node backup .` command to create a backup of your current node and save `sgx_data` folder for SGX wallet as well as `sgxwallet_backup_key.txt`
   </Aside>

## Migration Steps


### Migrate SGX

<Steps>
1. **Setup new server**

   Prepare a new server with:
   - Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)
   - SGX-enabled Intel processor
   - 8 physical cores
   - 16 GB RAM
   - 200 GB disk mounted as /
   - Swap size equals to half (1/2) of RAM size

2. **Install packages required for the node**

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
   sudo apt-get install -y docker.io docker-compose-plugin
   sudo apt-get install -y build-essential make cmake gcc g++ yasm  python libprotobuf10 flex bison automake libtool texinfo libgcrypt20-dev libgnutls28-dev
   sudo apt-get install -y docker
   sudo apt-get install -y libelf-dev cpuid
   ```

3. **Verify your processor supports Intel SGX with:**

   ```shell
   cpuid | grep SGX:
   ```

   <Aside type="caution" title="Important">
   After installing docker make sure that `live-restore` option
   is enabled in `/etc/docker/daemon.json`. See more info in the [docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/live-restore/).
   </Aside>

4. **Disable automatic updates**

   It's recommended to only update the SGXWallet server if there are critical security fixes. This is because SGXWallet is based on low
   level technology, and kernel updates may break the system. Currently SGX is tested on 5.15\* kernels. It's best to avoid minor version updates too.

   To make sure `apt update` won't update the kernel you should use apt-mark hold command:

   ```shell
   sudo apt-mark hold linux-generic linux-image-generic linux-headers-generic
   ```

   Also if you configured unattended upgrades, you should make sure kernel won't update automatically. To do this, add the following lines to `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades` file:

   ```shell
   Unattended-Upgrade::Package-Blacklist {
           "linux-generic";
           "linux-image-generic";
           "linux-headers-generic";
   };
   ```

   **Output**

   ```shell
   SGX: Software Guard Extensions supported = true
   ```

5. Configure firewall between SGX and node servers


6. Download SGXWallet source code

   Clone SGX Wallet Repository to your machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/skalenetwork/sgxwallet/
   cd sgxwallet
   git checkout stable
   ```

7. Enable SGX on the new server
   **SGX Wallet repository includes the sgx_enable utility. To enable SGX run:**

   ```shell
   sudo ./sgx_enable
   ```

   **Install SGX driver:**

   ```shell
   cd scripts
   sudo ./sgx_linux_x64_driver_2.11.b6f5b4a.bin
   cd ..
   ```

   **System Reboot:**

   <Aside type="note">
   Reboot your machine after driver install!
   </Aside>

   **Check driver installation:**
   To check that isgx device is properly installed run this command:

   ```shell
   ls /dev/isgx /dev/sg0
   ```

   If you don't see the isgx device, you need to troubleshoot your driver installation from [here](https://github.com/skalenetwork/sgxwallet/blob/develop/docs/enabling-sgx.md).

8. **Copy sgx_data folder to the new server**

   From your old server, securely transfer the SGX data:
   ```bash
   # On old server - create backup
   tar -czf sgx_data_backup.tar.gz -C sgxwallet/run_sgx sgx_data

   # Transfer to new server (use scp, rsync, or secure method)
   scp sgx_data_backup.tar.gz user@new-server:/path/to/transfer/

   # On new server - extract to correct location
   cd sgxwallet/run_sgx
   tar -xzf /path/to/transfer/sgx_data_backup.tar.gz
   ```

   <Aside type="caution" title="Important">
   After uploading backup to the new server make sure that sgxwallet_backup_key.txt is stored in sgx_data
   </Aside>


9. **Set the version and -b flag in docker-compose.yml**
   Edit the `sgxwallet/run_sgx/docker-compose.yml` file:

   - Change the image version to: `skalenetwork/sgxwallet:1.9.0-stable.4`
   - Add `-b` to the existing command section (don't replace the entire command, just add `-b` to it)


10. **Run docker-compose up -d**

      ```bash
      cd sgxwallet/run_sgx
      docker-compose up -d

      # Verify SGXWallet is running
      docker-compose ps
      docker-compose logs
      ```

</Steps>

### Migrate Node

<Steps>
1. **Setup new server**

   Prepare a new server with:
   - Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)
   - 8 physical cores
   - 32 GB RAM
   - 16 GB RAM
   - 100 GB disk mounted as /
   - 2Tb additional disk (not mounted)

2. **Install packages required for the node**

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
   sudo apt-get install -y docker.io docker-compose-plugin nftables
   ```

    <Aside type="caution" title="Important">
    After installing docker make sure that `live-restore` option
    is enabled in `/etc/docker/daemon.json`. See more info in the [docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/live-restore/).
    </Aside>

3. **Disable automatic updates**

   Currently SKALE Node is tested on 5.15\* kernels. It's best to avoid minor version updates too.

   To make sure `apt update` won't update the kernel you should use apt-mark hold command:

   ```shell
   sudo apt-mark hold linux-generic linux-image-generic linux-headers-generic
   ```

   Also if you configured unattended upgrades, you should make sure kernel won't update automatically. To do this, add the following lines to `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades` file:

   ```shell
   Unattended-Upgrade::Package-Blacklist {
           "linux-generic";
           "linux-image-generic";
           "linux-headers-generic";
   };
   ```

4. **Run node backup on old server**

   ```bash
   # On old server
   skale node backup .
   ```

   This will create a backup tarball (e.g., `skale-node-backup-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.tar.gz`)

5. **Copy backup tarball and .env config to the new server**

   ```bash
   # Transfer backup and configuration files
   scp skale-node-backup-*.tar.gz user@new-server:/path/to/new/location/
   scp .env user@new-server:/path/to/new/location/
   ```

6. **Download node-CLI version**

    ```bash
    curl -L https://github.com/skalenetwork/node-cli/releases/download/2.6.2/skale-2.6.2-Linux-x86_64 > /usr/local/bin/skale
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/skale

    # Verify installation
    skale --version
    ```

7. **Restore node from backup**

    ```bash
    # Navigate to your working directory
    cd backup tarball location

    # Restore node using backup and environment file
    skale node restore skale-node-backup-*.tar.gz .env
    ```
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
Keep the old server running until you've fully verified the new setup is working correctly. This allows for quick rollback if needed.

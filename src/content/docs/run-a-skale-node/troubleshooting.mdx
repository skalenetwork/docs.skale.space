<summary>How do I change my Node's IP address?</summary>
See [Changing Node IP](/ecosystem/validators/node-cli/changing-node-ip) in the Node CLI section.

<summary>How should validators configure backup and restore?</summary>

Validators are responsible for backing up everything on the supernode. SKALE Network relies on validators to complete the backup procedure for each of the supernodes. SKALE Network replicates the data for each SKALE Chain across 16 nodes, adding an additional layer of data availability. If a node goes down for a long time, the other 2/3 of 15 will be responsible for taking the SKALE Chain's snapshot and shuffling the SKALE Chain in the SKALE Network. If a validator supernode is down for a long time, it may be reallocated to service new SKALE Chains depending on the length of the downtime.

Please check [supernode backup](https://github.com/skalenetwork/skale-node-cli/blob/develop/README.md#node-commands) and [sgx_backup](https://github.com/skalenetwork/sgxwallet/blob/develop/docs/backup-procedure.md) to learn more about how to back up the supernode or SGXWallet, and restore.

<details>
<summary>Where are the network communications between containers, shared configuration files, and volumes stored?</summary>
You can find these details in the [skale-node](https://github.com/skalenetwork/skale-node) repository and the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/skalenetwork/skale-node/blob/f928b95e69c548f12b4b21bd11a16fe2d239b83b/docker-compose.yml).
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I access the SKALE Chain's IP and ports?</summary>
You can use the node-cli to view firewall info and SKALE Chain info:
```shell
# Show firewall rules for IP and Ports
skale schains show-rules

# Show the SKALE Chain Config
skale schains config [SCHAIN_NAME]
```

In this file, you can see all the SKALE Chain information:

<summary>Can I use Kubernetes?</summary>
Yes. However, you will need to make sure that your platform is compatible with SKALE. In particular, your platform must allow docker-lvmpy to dynamically partition the external drive for each SKALE chain.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Where can I find the SKALE Supernode logs?</summary>

Validators can run these commands to check their logs in their supernode:

Here are some logs and commands you can use for troubleshooting or to provide logs to the core team. The most used and first place to look at:

```shell
docker logs skale_api
```

or

```shell
docker logs skale_admin
```

Transaction manager logs:

```shell
docker logs skale_transaction_manager
```

All running containers logs:

```shell
skale logs dump [PATH]
```

SGX certification in validator supernode:

```shell
ls -l ~/.skale/node_data/sgx_certs/
```

SGX wallet logs:

```shell
docker logs runsgx_sgxwallet_1
```

Node-cli debugging logs:

```shell
~/.skale/.skale-cli-log/debug-node-cli.log
```

Docker-lvmpy logs:

```shell
cat /var/log/docker-lvmpy/lvmpy.log
```

<summary>Why is SGX crashing after machine reboot?</summary>

SGXWallet may crash after a reboot if you didn't disable automatic updates. This is because SGXWallet is based on new low-level technology, and kernel updates may break the system. It's recommended to only update the SGXWallet server if there are critical security fixes.

<details>
<summary>Supernode update procedure</summary>

Updating system packages is an important part of supernode maintenance and security. Updates may contain fixes for recent security issues. However, newer updates may be incompatible with SKALE supernode software. Therefore, updating should be executed carefully.

<Aside type="caution">
Make sure that the infrastructure provider doesn't update packages after the system is restarted.
The following list contains packages that require additional attention.
Critical risk (updates should be performed only if there are some messages from the core team):
  - kernel updates on SGXWallet server.
</Aside>
<Aside type="note">
Currently, SGX is tested on 4.15-* kernels. It's best to avoid minor version updates too.
**High Risk** (updates should be avoided in general):
- kernel on SKALE supernode server
- docker
- docker-compose
- btrfs-progs

**Medium Risk** (updates should be performed very carefully):
- lvm2
- iptables
- iptables-persistent
- python
</Aside>
**General tips**

1. Carefully check which packages will be updated when executing `apt upgrade`. You can use `apt list --upgradable`
2. Avoid executing `apt dist-upgrade`
3. Disabling updates for certain packages can be done using `apt-mark hold` ([apt-mark man page](https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/apt/apt-mark.8.en.html)). For example, to forbid kernel updates you should run:

    ```shell
    sudo apt-mark hold linux-generic linux-image-generic linux-headers-generic
    ```

Another option is to use unattended upgrades ([Unattended Upgrades wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/UnattendedUpgrades)), which allows you to automatically keep the system current with the latest security updates. There is an option to exclude some packages from the update list using the `Package-Blacklist` section in the configuration file. For example, to disallow Linux kernel updates, you should place the following lines in the `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades` file:

```shell
Unattended-Upgrade::Package-Blacklist {
        "linux-generic";
        "linux-image-generic";
        "linux-headers-generic";
};
```

## Overview

SKALE is designed for consumer-grade UX, but many industries also need confidentiality. BITE Protocol adds privacy-first capabilities—encrypted transactions, confidential apps (cApps), and cross-chain privacy—without breaking EVM compatibility.

## The Value of Privacy

Privacy unlocks:
- Confidential transactions for businesses and consumers
- Compliance with data protection rules (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- Competitive advantage by protecting proprietary data
- User safety across finance, healthcare, AI agents, and enterprise workloads

## Privacy Challenges on Traditional Blockchains

Public ledgers expose amounts, participants, and intent. That’s incompatible with many real-world use cases and invites MEV and front-running.

## How BITE Protocol Solves Privacy

BITE (Blockchain Interoperability and Trustless Execution) delivers:
- **Confidential applications (cApps)** – Encrypted inputs/state with selective disclosure.
- **Trustless execution** – Threshold encryption and TEEs secure data without trusted middlemen.
- **Cross-chain privacy** – Keep data confidential while moving between SKALE Chains and beyond.
- **MEV resistance** – Encrypt destination and calldata until after finality.

## Use Cases Enabled by Privacy

- **Confidential AI** – Process sensitive features safely.
- **Private finance** – Hide amounts and intent to prevent MEV.
- **Healthcare** – Keep patient data private while auditable.
- **Supply chain** – Protect pricing and partner information.
- **Enterprise** – Meet compliance without giving up blockchain benefits.

## Implementation

- **BITE Protocol** – Threshold encryption and commit-then-reveal flows.
- **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)** – Hardware-backed confidentiality.
- **Advanced cryptography** – Threshold schemes, encryption, and verifiable randomness.
- **Secure messaging** – Confidential communication across chains.

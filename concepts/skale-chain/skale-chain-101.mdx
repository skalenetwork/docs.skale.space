## Overview

The SKALE Network is the home of multiple SKALE Chains meaning within the SKALE Ecosystem it's possible to create multiple SKALE Chains. 

All the created SKALE Chains inherit the following features:
- EVM Compatible
- Instant finality
- Zero gas fees
- Native RNG
- Native filestorage
- Native bridge

This SKALE Chains or sChains are uniquely designed to offer both permissioned and permisionless compute; sChains are themselves are Layer 1 blockchains with additional layers of modular management and functionality enabling them to exist as an Appchain or as an ecosystem chain like a hub.

When a new SKALE Chain is created, the owner of the chain is provided elevated privileges which they can use to setup the chain to their unique needs. Privileges can be provided to others, secured via multisigs, or renounced entirely.
## What's a SKALE Chain?

Every SKALE Chain is a Layer 1 blockchain. SKALE is not a Layer 2 or a sidechain. SKALE Manager — the brain of SKALE — does live on the Ethereum mainnet and Base today, however, each and every SKALE Chain maintains its own state independently of Ethereum and leverages the SKALE shared validator pool, not Ethereum or Base validators.

Each sChain has their own [consensus](../consensus), block production and validator nodes.

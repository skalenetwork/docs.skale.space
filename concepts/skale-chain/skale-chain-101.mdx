## Overview

SKALE hosts many elastic SKALE Chains—each a full EVM Layer 1 with zero gas fees and instant finality. Chains can be app-specific, ecosystem hubs, or enterprise/private environments, all secured by the shared validator pool that stakes on Ethereum.

Every SKALE Chain comes with:
- Full EVM compatibility
- Instant finality via BLS threshold signatures
- Zero gas fees using sFUEL
- Native randomness, file storage, and bridging

SKALE Chains support permissionless and permissioned setups. Operators configure validators, access control, and optional gas policies to fit their use case—then rotate privileges, delegate via multisig, or fully renounce for community control.
## What's a SKALE Chain?

Every SKALE Chain is its own L1. SKALE is not a rollup or sidechain; chains keep independent state and consensus while Ethereum (and other bases via SKALE Expand) hosts the control-plane contracts. Validator committees rotate across chains, sign blocks with BLS, and deliver instant finality without sacrificing decentralization.

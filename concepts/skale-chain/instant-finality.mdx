title: "Instant Finality"
description: "Why SKALE blocks are irreversible the moment they land"

## Overview

On SKALE, transactions are final as soon as their block is committed—no 6-block wait, no reorg anxiety. BLS threshold signatures from a supermajority of the chain’s validators make each block irreversible the moment it lands. That’s the foundation for real-time apps, games, and AI agents.

## Instant Finality

Once a transaction is included and the block is signed by ≥2/3 of validators, it cannot be rolled back. There’s no incentive or ability to reorder finalized transactions, which keeps user flows snappy and predictable.

## Benefits

- **Immediate confirmation** – Ideal for payments, gaming, and AI agents.
- **Predictable UX** – Users never wait for multiple confirmations or watch mempools.
- **DeFi-ready** – Settlements and liquidations execute without reorg risk.

## How It Works

SKALE’s asynchronous BFT consensus reaches agreement first, then validators produce a BLS threshold signature. That signature is cryptographic proof that a supermajority agreed, making the block immutable.

## Use Cases

- **Payments** – Instant receipts and settlements.
- **Agents** – Autonomous agents can act on-chain state immediately.
- **Gaming** – Real-time state sync without rollbacks.
- **DeFi** – Immediate settlement for swaps, lending, and auctions.

Threshold schemes let a group share control of a secret (like a private key) so no single participant can use it alone. On SKALE, threshold cryptography powers BLS signatures, DKG, and pooled security. Here’s the high-level story.

## The basic idea

A `(k, n)` threshold scheme splits a secret into `n` shares. Any `k` shares can reconstruct the secret; fewer than `k` reveal nothing. This is typically done with polynomials: pick a polynomial where the secret is the constant term, hand each participant a point on that curve, and require `k` points to rebuild it.

## Shamir’s Secret Sharing (SSS)

SSS is the classic approach: a dealer creates the polynomial, hands out shares, and `k` participants can later interpolate to recover the secret. The downside: the dealer knows everything, so you must trust them.

## From SSS to Distributed Key Generation (DKG)

DKG removes the trusted dealer. Every participant creates their own polynomial and shares a piece of it with everyone else. When all the partial polynomials are summed, the group gets:
- A public key (from the summed public polynomials)
- Private key shares (each participant holds their own summed share)

No single party ever sees the full secret key, yet the group can still produce threshold signatures.

## Why SKALE uses threshold crypto

- **Security against collusion** – You need a supermajority of validators to act together to sign or decrypt.
- **Instant finality with BLS** – Validators combine shares into a single BLS signature that proves supermajority agreement.
- **Rotation-friendly** – New committees can rerun DKG to refresh keys every epoch.

SKALE Chains are elastic L1s that can be tuned for permissionless apps, ecosystem hubs, or private/enterprise workloads. They inherit zero gas fees, instant finality, and pooled security while letting operators choose custom policies, access controls, and pricing models.

When you launch a chain, you get configuration rights that can be delegated to teammates, secured with multisig, or fully renounced for community control.

## Launching a SKALE Chain

- Review the [setup requirements](/developers/run-a-skale-chain/setup-requirements).
- Decide what to [customize on your SKALE Chain](/developers/run-a-skale-chain/customize-schain) (gas policy, permissions, resources).
- Request creation in [Discord](https://discord.gg/skale) or through your SKALE partner channel.

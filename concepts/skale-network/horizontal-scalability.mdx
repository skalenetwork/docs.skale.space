## Overview

SKALE scales out by adding new SKALE Chains whenever demand rises. Each chain is its own EVM L1 with zero gas fees and instant finality. Instead of cramming more into a single chain, SKALE adds fresh capacity in parallel, so throughput grows linearly while UX stays fast.

## What is Horizontal Scalability?

Add chains, not hardware. Each new SKALE Chain brings dedicated compute, storage, and bandwidth, while still tapping into the same validator pool and Ethereum-anchored security.

## How SKALE Scales Horizontally

1. **Create a chain** via SKALE Manager on Ethereum.
2. **Allocate resources** (virtualized CPU, RAM, storage) and assign a validator committee.
3. **Spin up containers** on validator nodes; the chain comes online with instant finality and zero gas fees.
4. **Repeat** as demand grows—no congestion spillover.

Shared validators and containerized nodes make the economics work: operators secure multiple chains, and chain owners pay predictable monthly fees instead of per-transaction gas.

## Benefits

- **On-demand growth** – Add chains as traffic spikes; no theoretical cap on chain count.
- **Predictable performance** – Each chain keeps low latency and high TPS even during surges.
- **Cost control** – Flat monthly pricing per chain, not per transaction.
- **Developer agility** – Launch appchains, ecosystem hubs, or private chains without competing for block space.

## Scaling Mechanisms

- **Virtualization & containers** – Isolate resources per chain on validator hardware.
- **Node rotation** – Balanced committees keep security consistent as chains proliferate.
- **Bridges** – Move assets between chains and Ethereum without central chokepoints.

## Comparison to Vertical Scaling

- **Vertical** – Bigger blocks and higher gas limits hit hardware ceilings and decentralization tradeoffs.
- **SKALE horizontal** – More chains, same UX, no need to sacrifice security or decentralization.

## Use Cases

- **Consumer apps** – Keep UX smooth during viral spikes.
- **Gaming and AI agents** – Dedicated chains for state-heavy workloads.
- **Enterprises** – Launch isolated environments with predictable performance.

## Implementation

- **SKALE Manager** for chain creation and pricing.
- **Containerized nodes** for multi-chain hosting.
- **Virtualized blockchains** for resource isolation.
- **Node rotation** to keep committees balanced as the network grows.

## Overview

SKALE Network employs a pooled security model where validators secure multiple SKALE Chains through a shared validator pool. This model provides strong security guarantees while enabling efficient resource utilization.

## How Pooled Security Works

In SKALE's pooled security model:

- **Shared Validator Pool** - Validators participate in a shared pool that secures multiple chains
- **Node Rotation** - Nodes are rotated across different SKALE Chains to ensure fair distribution
- **Unified Validation** - Validators validate multiple chains, not just one
- **Security Aggregation** - Security is aggregated across all chains in the network

## Key Components

### Validator Pool

The validator pool consists of all validators participating in the SKALE Network. These validators collectively secure all SKALE Chains.

### Node Rotation

Nodes are rotated across different SKALE Chains through the NodeRotation contract. This ensures:

- **Fair Distribution** - Resources are fairly distributed across chains
- **Security Diversity** - Each chain is secured by a diverse set of validators
- **Resource Efficiency** - Validators can secure multiple chains efficiently

### Unified Validation

Validators validate multiple chains simultaneously, providing:

- **Economies of Scale** - More efficient use of validator resources
- **Cross-Chain Security** - Security benefits from the entire network
- **Reduced Costs** - Lower costs for securing individual chains

## Security Guarantees

The pooled security model provides:

- **High Security** - Each chain benefits from the security of the entire network
- **Fault Tolerance** - Chains remain secure even if some validators fail
- **Byzantine Resistance** - Protection against Byzantine failures
- **Economic Security** - Validators have economic incentives to maintain security

## Benefits

### For Chain Owners

- **Lower Costs** - Reduced costs compared to dedicated validators
- **High Security** - Benefit from network-wide security
- **Scalability** - Easy to add new chains without dedicated validators

### For Validators

- **Efficient Resource Use** - Secure multiple chains with the same infrastructure
- **Diversified Revenue** - Earn rewards from multiple chains
- **Network Effects** - Benefit from network growth

### For Users

- **Consistent Security** - All chains have similar security guarantees
- **Lower Fees** - Reduced costs passed on to users
- **Reliability** - High uptime and reliability

## Comparison to Other Models

### Dedicated Validators

Unlike chains with dedicated validators, SKALE's pooled model:

- **More Efficient** - Better resource utilization
- **More Secure** - Larger validator set per chain
- **More Economical** - Lower costs for chain owners

### Shared Security

SKALE's pooled security differs from shared security models by:

- **Independent Chains** - Each chain maintains independent state
- **Flexible Allocation** - Resources can be allocated dynamically
- **Network-Wide Benefits** - Security benefits scale with network size

## Implementation

Pooled security is implemented through:

- **SKALE Manager** - Coordinates validator allocation and chain security
- **NodeRotation** - Manages node rotation across chains
- **ValidatorService** - Manages validator registration and participation
- **DelegationController** - Handles staking and delegation

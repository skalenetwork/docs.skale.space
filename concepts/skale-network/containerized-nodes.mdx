## Overview

SKALE nodes run in lightweight containers so a single server can secure multiple SKALE Chains at once. This keeps costs low for validators and chain owners while isolating resources and failures between chains.


## What are Containerized Nodes?

Containerization packages the SKALE node runtime (consensus, execution, storage, networking) into isolated units. Each container is mapped to a chain assignment, with dedicated CPU/memory limits and network isolation. Validators can run several containers on one host, maximizing utilization while keeping faults contained.

## Architecture

- **Container runtime** – Docker-style containers with cgroups limits to guarantee CPU/memory boundaries per chain.
- **Network isolation** – Virtual networking separates chain traffic and prevents cross-talk.
- **Chain mapping** – Each container is bound to a chain assignment from SKALE Manager and participates in its consensus committee.

## Benefits

- **Efficiency** – Run multiple chains per server, reducing hardware costs.
- **Isolation** – Performance or faults on one chain don’t spill into others.
- **Rapid deployment** – Start, stop, or rotate chain assignments in minutes.
- **Elastic scale** – Add containers for new chains without rebuilding infrastructure.


## How It Works

When SKALE Manager assigns a node to a chain, the validator spins up a container with the right configuration, keys, and resource limits. Containers receive proposals, sign blocks, store state, and rotate out cleanly when the node’s assignment changes.

## Implementation Details

- **Runtime** – Docker-compatible runtime; orchestration via Kubernetes or similar is common for fleets.
- **Resource controls** – cgroups/quotas for CPU, RAM, and storage per chain.
- **Observability** – Per-container metrics/logging simplify troubleshooting and SLA reporting.

## Use Cases

- **Validator economics** – Higher rewards per server by hosting multiple chains.
- **Enterprise deployments** – Run isolated environments for business units or partners.
- **Testing** – Spin up short-lived chains or environments without new hardware.

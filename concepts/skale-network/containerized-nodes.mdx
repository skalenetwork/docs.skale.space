## Overview

SKALE Network uses containerization technology to enable efficient node operations, allowing a single physical server to support multiple SKALE Chains. This architecture enables horizontal scalability and efficient resource utilization.

## What are Containerized Nodes?

Containerized nodes run SKALE node software in isolated containers (such as Docker containers), allowing:

- **Multiple Chains per Server** - A single physical server can support multiple SKALE Chains
- **Resource Isolation** - Each chain's resources are isolated from others
- **Efficient Resource Use** - Better utilization of server resources
- **Easy Deployment** - Simplified node deployment and management

## Architecture

### Container Technology

SKALE nodes run in virtualization containers:

- **Docker Containers** - Typical implementation uses Docker containers
- **Isolated Environments** - Each container provides isolated execution environment
- **Resource Allocation** - Resources allocated per container/chain
- **Network Isolation** - Network isolation between containers

### Node Implementation

A typical implementation:

- **Network Node** - Runs SKALE consensus and validation
- **Storage** - Stores chain state and data
- **Multiple Chains** - Supports multiple SKALE Chains simultaneously
- **Resource Sharing** - Shares physical resources across chains

## Benefits

### Efficiency

- **Resource Utilization** - Better use of server resources
- **Cost Reduction** - Lower costs per chain
- **Scalability** - Easy to scale by adding containers
- **Flexibility** - Flexible resource allocation

### Operations

- **Easy Deployment** - Simplified node deployment
- **Management** - Easier node management and updates
- **Isolation** - Fault isolation between chains
- **Monitoring** - Easier monitoring and debugging

### Network

- **Horizontal Scaling** - Add capacity by adding containers
- **Resource Efficiency** - Efficient use of network resources
- **Cost Effectiveness** - Lower costs for chain owners
- **Flexibility** - Flexible chain resource allocation

## How It Works

### Container Allocation

When a SKALE Chain is created:

1. **Resource Allocation** - Resources are allocated for the chain
2. **Container Creation** - A container is created for the chain
3. **Node Deployment** - SKALE node software is deployed in the container
4. **Chain Assignment** - The container is assigned to the chain
5. **Operation** - The node validates and stores chain data

### Multi-Chain Support

A single physical server can support multiple chains:

- **Separate Containers** - Each chain runs in its own container
- **Resource Allocation** - Resources allocated per chain
- **Isolated Execution** - Chains operate independently
- **Shared Infrastructure** - Physical infrastructure shared across chains

## Implementation Details

### Container Technology

SKALE uses containerization technologies such as:

- **Docker** - Most common implementation
- **Kubernetes** - For orchestration at scale
- **Container Runtime** - Standard container runtimes
- **Orchestration** - Container orchestration tools

### Resource Management

Resources are managed through:

- **Allocation** - Resources allocated per container
- **Limits** - Resource limits per container
- **Monitoring** - Resource usage monitoring
- **Scaling** - Dynamic resource scaling

## Use Cases

Containerized nodes enable:

- **Multiple Chains** - Support for multiple chains per server
- **Cost Efficiency** - Lower costs for chain operations
- **Scalability** - Easy horizontal scaling
- **Flexibility** - Flexible resource allocation

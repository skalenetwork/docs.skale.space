## Overview

SKALE Manager is the core set of smart contracts deployed on Ethereum mainnet that coordinate and manage the SKALE Network. It serves as the "brain" of SKALE, handling chain creation, validator management, staking, delegation, and network operations.

## Core Components

### ContractManager

The central registry that manages all other SKALE Manager contracts. It provides a single entry point for accessing all network components.

### SKALE Chains

Manages SKALE Chain creation, configuration, and lifecycle. Handles chain registration, metadata, and status tracking.

### SchainsInternal

Internal contract handling chain state and operations not exposed through the public interface.

### Nodes

Manages validator nodes in the network. Tracks node registration, status, and participation in chains.

### ValidatorService

Handles validator registration, configuration, and management. Validators register here to participate in the network.

### DelegationController

Manages SKL token delegation from delegators to validators. Handles delegation amounts, periods, and rewards distribution.

### DelegationPeriodManager

Manages delegation periods and their associated parameters. Delegators can choose different staking periods with varying rewards.

### Distributor

Distributes rewards to validators and delegators based on their participation and delegation amounts.

### BountyV2

Manages bounty payments to validators for securing the network. Bounties are distributed monthly based on validator performance.

### Punisher

Handles slashing and penalties for validators that violate network rules or fail to meet compliance requirements.

### SlashingTable

Defines the slashing rules and penalties for various types of validator misbehavior.

### NodeRotation

Manages the rotation of nodes across different SKALE Chains. Ensures fair distribution of validator resources.

### ConstantsHolder

Stores network-wide constants and configuration parameters that can be updated through governance.

### Wallets

Manages validator wallets and their associated permissions. Handles wallet creation and access control.

### TimeHelpers

Provides time-based utilities for the network, including block timestamp management and time-based operations.

### Pricing

Manages pricing for SKALE Chain creation and operation. Handles payment processing and fee collection.

## Network Operations

SKALE Manager coordinates:

- **Chain Creation** - New SKALE Chains are created through SKALE Chains contract
- **Validator Management** - Validators register and manage their nodes
- **Staking & Delegation** - SKL tokens are staked and delegated through DelegationController
- **Rewards Distribution** - Rewards are distributed through Distributor and BountyV2
- **Node Rotation** - Nodes are rotated across chains through NodeRotation
- **Compliance** - Validator compliance is monitored through Punisher and SlashingTable

## Integration Points

SKALE Manager integrates with:

- **Ethereum Mainnet** - All contracts are deployed on Ethereum
- **SKALE Chains** - Chains interact with Manager for coordination
- **Validators** - Validators interact with Manager for registration and rewards
- **Delegators** - Delegators interact with Manager for staking
- **Chain Owners** - Chain owners interact with Manager for chain creation

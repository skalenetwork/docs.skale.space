## Overview

SKALE Manager is a suite of smart contracts on Ethereum that runs the SKALE control plane—staking, delegation, pricing, chain creation, validator rotation, and slashing. Keeping governance and economics on Ethereum gives SKALE transparent, tamper-resistant coordination while SKALE Chains focus on high-speed execution with zero gas fees.

## Core Components

- **ContractManager** – Registry of all SKALE Manager modules.
- **SChains/SChainsInternal** – Chain creation, metadata, and lifecycle tracking.
- **Nodes & ValidatorService** – Validator registration, configuration, and performance data.
- **DelegationController & DelegationPeriodManager** – SKL delegation, lock periods, and rewards logic.
- **Distributor & BountyV2** – Monthly reward distribution for validators and delegators.
- **Punisher & SlashingTable** – Enforcement of downtime and misbehavior penalties.
- **NodeRotation** – Randomized committee assignments across chains.
- **ConstantsHolder & Pricing** – Network parameters, chain pricing, and payment handling.

## Network Operations

SKALE Manager coordinates:

- **Chain creation** – Register new SKALE Chains, allocate resources, set pricing.
- **Validator lifecycle** – Register nodes, verify capacity, and rotate committees.
- **Staking & delegation** – Lock SKL, manage periods, and aggregate validator stake.
- **Rewards** – Monthly payouts based on performance and stake weight.
- **Compliance & slashing** – Detect downtime or protocol violations and penalize accordingly.
- **Pricing & billing** – Handle monthly fees for chain operators.

## Integration Points

SKALE Manager integrates with:

- **Ethereum mainnet** – The source of truth for staking, rotation, and slashing.
- **SKALE Chains** – Pull committee assignments and report performance.
- **Validators & delegators** – Stake SKL, claim rewards, and manage participation.
- **Chain owners** – Create, configure, and renew chains with predictable pricing.

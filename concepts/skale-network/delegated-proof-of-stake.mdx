## Overview

SKALE Network uses a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism where token holders delegate their SKL tokens to validators who secure the network. This model combines the security of proof-of-stake with the efficiency of delegation.

## How DPoS Works

In SKALE's DPoS model:

- **Validators** - Run nodes and stake SKL tokens to secure the network
- **Delegators** - Delegate SKL tokens to validators without running nodes
- **Staking** - SKL tokens are staked to participate in network security
- **Rewards** - Validators and delegators earn rewards for securing the network

## Key Components

### Validators

Validators are responsible for:

- **Running Nodes** - Operating SKALE nodes to validate transactions
- **Staking SKL** - Staking SKL tokens to participate in consensus
- **Block Production** - Producing and validating blocks
- **Network Security** - Maintaining network security and uptime

### Delegators

Delegators participate by:

- **Delegating SKL** - Delegating SKL tokens to validators
- **Earning Rewards** - Receiving rewards proportional to their delegation
- **Governance** - Participating in network governance
- **Supporting Validators** - Supporting validators without running nodes

### Staking

Staking involves:

- **Locking Tokens** - SKL tokens are locked when staked
- **Staking Periods** - Different staking periods with varying rewards
- **Unbonding** - Tokens can be unbonded after a period
- **Slashing** - Risk of slashing for validator misbehavior

## Consensus Process

SKALE's DPoS consensus:

1. **Validator Selection** - Validators are selected based on stake
2. **Block Proposal** - Validators propose blocks
3. **Block Validation** - Validators validate proposed blocks
4. **Finalization** - Blocks are finalized with threshold signatures
5. **Rewards Distribution** - Rewards are distributed to validators and delegators

## Staking Lifecycle

The staking lifecycle includes:

1. **Propose Delegation** - Delegator proposes delegation to a validator
2. **Accepted** - Validator accepts the delegation
3. **Staked** - Tokens are staked and earning rewards
4. **Undelegation Request** - Delegator requests to undelegate
5. **Unbonded** - Tokens are unbonded and can be withdrawn

## Benefits of DPoS

### Efficiency

- **Fast Consensus** - Faster block times compared to traditional PoS
- **Low Energy** - Energy-efficient compared to proof-of-work
- **Scalability** - Supports high transaction throughput

### Security

- **Economic Security** - Validators have economic stake in network security
- **Slashing** - Validators can be slashed for misbehavior
- **Decentralization** - Multiple validators secure the network

### Participation

- **Accessibility** - Delegators can participate without running nodes
- **Flexibility** - Delegators can choose validators and staking periods
- **Governance** - Delegators can participate in governance

## Staking Rewards

Staking rewards are distributed based on:

- **Staking Amount** - Amount of SKL staked
- **Staking Period** - Duration of staking period
- **Validator Performance** - Validator uptime and participation
- **Network Participation** - Participation in network operations

## Validator Requirements

Validators must:

- **Stake SKL** - Stake minimum amount of SKL tokens
- **Run Nodes** - Operate SKALE nodes with required specifications
- **Maintain Uptime** - Maintain high uptime and availability
- **Comply with Rules** - Follow network rules and regulations

## Delegator Considerations

Delegators should consider:

- **Validator Selection** - Choose reliable validators
- **Staking Period** - Select appropriate staking period
- **Rewards** - Understand reward structure and distribution
- **Risks** - Be aware of slashing and unbonding risks

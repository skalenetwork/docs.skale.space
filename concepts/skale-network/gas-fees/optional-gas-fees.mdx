## Overview

SKALE defaults to zero gas fees, but chain operators can optionally enable gas pricing for specific behaviors. This lets you add incentives for priority transactions or throttle high-load scenarios while keeping everyday UX free.

## When to Use Optional Gas Fees

Use optional fees when you need:

- **Priority lanes** – Let users pay to jump the queue during spikes.
- **Economic signals** – Deter abusive workloads or align heavy users with validator costs.
- **Load shedding** – Add friction during exceptional traffic to protect uptime.

## Implementation

Optional gas mirrors Ethereum’s model but is fully configurable:

- Set base and priority fee policies.
- Adjust gas limits per block to match your workload.
- Combine with sFUEL distribution so most users still feel gasless.

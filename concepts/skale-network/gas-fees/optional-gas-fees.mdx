## Overview

While SKALE offers zero gas fees by default, chain operators can optionally enable gas fees for specific use cases or to provide additional economic incentives.

## When to Use Optional Gas Fees

Optional gas fees can be useful for:

- **Priority transactions** - Users can pay gas to prioritize their transactions
- **Economic incentives** - Aligning incentives between users and validators
- **Resource management** - Managing network resources during high load periods

## Implementation

Optional gas fees on SKALE work similarly to Ethereum's gas model, but are entirely optional. Chain operators can configure:

- Gas price mechanisms
- Gas limit policies
- Priority fee structures

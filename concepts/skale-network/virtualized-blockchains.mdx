## Overview

SKALE virtualizes compute, memory, storage, and networking so many independent SKALE Chains can share the same validator hardware without interfering with each other. Each chain feels like its own dedicated L1 while benefiting from pooled security and efficient hosting.

## What are Virtualized Blockchains?

Independent chains with dedicated resources mapped virtually onto shared servers. State, consensus, and networking are isolated; only the physical hardware is shared.

## Architecture

- **Resource abstraction** – CPU, RAM, storage, and bandwidth are carved into allocations per chain.
- **Isolation** – cgroups and network namespaces keep workloads separated.
- **Management** – SKALE Manager and node orchestration tie allocations to chain assignments.
- **Chain independence** – Each chain runs its own consensus and EVM state without sharing data paths.

## Benefits

- **Efficiency** – Maximize hardware utilization across many chains.
- **Isolation** – Performance issues on one chain don’t impact others.
- **Fast deployment** – Bring new chains online quickly with predefined resource slices.
- **Predictability** – Each chain keeps consistent performance regardless of neighbors.

## How It Works

When a chain is commissioned, SKALE Manager assigns validators and the node runtime reserves CPU, RAM, storage, and network capacity for that chain. The chain then runs independently in its own container with virtualized resources and participates in its consensus committee.

## Implementation

- **Containers** – Docker-style isolation with explicit resource limits.
- **Scheduler/orchestration** – Cluster tooling (e.g., Kubernetes) to place and monitor chain containers.
- **Per-chain networking** – Virtual networks to segregate peer traffic and APIs.

## Use Cases

- **Appchains** – Dedicated performance for a single application.
- **Hub chains** – Multi-app environments with shared liquidity.
- **Enterprise/private** – Segmented environments with strict isolation.
- **Test/dev** – Spin up temporary chains without new hardware.

## Comparison to Other Models

- **Dedicated bare metal** – Higher cost and slower deployment per chain.
- **Un-virtualized sharing** – Risks noisy-neighbor effects; SKALE avoids that with isolation and quotas.

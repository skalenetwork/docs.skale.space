## Overview

SKALE Network virtualizes blockchain resources, allowing multiple independent blockchains (SKALE Chains) to run on shared infrastructure. This virtualization enables efficient resource utilization and horizontal scalability.

## What are Virtualized Blockchains?

Virtualized blockchains are independent blockchains that share underlying infrastructure:

- **Independent State** - Each chain maintains its own independent state
- **Shared Infrastructure** - Chains share physical infrastructure
- **Resource Virtualization** - Resources are virtualized and allocated per chain
- **Isolated Execution** - Chains execute in isolated environments

## Architecture

### Virtualization Layer

SKALE's virtualization layer provides:

- **Resource Abstraction** - Abstracts physical resources
- **Allocation** - Allocates resources to chains
- **Isolation** - Isolates chains from each other
- **Management** - Manages resource lifecycle

### Chain Independence

Each virtualized chain:

- **Independent State** - Maintains its own blockchain state
- **Independent Consensus** - Runs its own consensus mechanism
- **Independent Storage** - Has its own storage allocation
- **Independent Network** - Operates on its own network segment

## Benefits

### Efficiency

- **Resource Utilization** - Better use of infrastructure resources
- **Cost Reduction** - Lower costs per chain
- **Scalability** - Easy to add new chains
- **Flexibility** - Flexible resource allocation

### Operations

- **Easy Deployment** - Simplified chain deployment
- **Management** - Easier chain management
- **Isolation** - Fault isolation between chains
- **Monitoring** - Easier monitoring and debugging

### Network

- **Horizontal Scaling** - Add capacity by adding chains
- **Resource Efficiency** - Efficient use of network resources
- **Cost Effectiveness** - Lower costs for chain owners
- **Flexibility** - Flexible chain configurations

## How It Works

### Chain Creation

When a SKALE Chain is created:

1. **Resource Allocation** - Resources are allocated for the chain
2. **Virtualization** - Resources are virtualized for the chain
3. **Node Assignment** - Nodes are assigned to the chain
4. **Chain Initialization** - Chain is initialized with its configuration
5. **Operation** - Chain begins operating independently

### Resource Virtualization

Resources are virtualized through:

- **CPU Virtualization** - CPU resources allocated per chain
- **Memory Virtualization** - Memory allocated per chain
- **Storage Virtualization** - Storage allocated per chain
- **Network Virtualization** - Network resources allocated per chain

### Multi-Chain Operation

Multiple chains operate simultaneously:

- **Shared Infrastructure** - Chains share physical infrastructure
- **Isolated Execution** - Chains execute in isolated environments
- **Resource Allocation** - Resources allocated per chain
- **Independent Operation** - Chains operate independently

## Implementation

### Containerization

Virtualization is implemented through:

- **Container Technology** - Uses containerization (Docker, etc.)
- **Resource Limits** - Resource limits per container/chain
- **Isolation** - Container isolation between chains
- **Orchestration** - Container orchestration for management

### Node Architecture

Nodes support virtualization through:

- **Multi-Chain Support** - Nodes can support multiple chains
- **Resource Allocation** - Resources allocated per chain
- **Isolated Execution** - Chains execute in isolated environments
- **Shared Infrastructure** - Physical infrastructure shared

## Use Cases

Virtualized blockchains enable:

- **App Chains** - Dedicated chains for applications
- **Hub Chains** - Shared chains for multiple applications
- **Enterprise Chains** - Private chains for enterprises
- **Test Chains** - Test and development chains

## Comparison to Other Models

### Dedicated Chains

Unlike chains with dedicated infrastructure:

- **More Efficient** - Better resource utilization
- **Lower Costs** - Reduced costs per chain
- **Easier Scaling** - Easier to add new chains
- **Flexible Allocation** - Flexible resource allocation

### Shared Infrastructure

SKALE's virtualization differs from shared infrastructure by:

- **Independent State** - Each chain maintains independent state
- **Isolated Execution** - Chains execute in isolated environments
- **Flexible Allocation** - Flexible resource allocation
- **Network Benefits** - Benefits from network-wide resources

## Overview

The SKALE Network is a network of interconnected Layer 1 blockchains, each operating independently while leveraging shared security from the broader network. The network is designed to support billions of agents and scale to global adoption.

## Network Architecture

The SKALE Network consists of:

- **Multiple SKALE Chains** - Each chain operates as an independent Layer 1 blockchain
- **Shared Validator Pool** - Validators secure multiple chains through rotation
- **SKALE Manager** - Core contracts on Ethereum that coordinate the network
- **Bridges** - Native bridges connecting chains to Ethereum and other networks

## Key Characteristics

- **Infinite Scalability** - Add new chains to scale capacity
- **Zero Gas Fees** - Transactions on SKALE Chains have no gas costs
- **Instant Finality** - Transactions are final immediately
- **EVM Compatible** - Full compatibility with Ethereum tooling

## SKALE Expand

SKALE Expand enables deployment of SKALE Chains on new base chains, extending the SKALE Network beyond Ethereum. The first SKALE Expand deployment is on Base Sepolia testnet.

## Network Components

- **Validators** - Secure the network by running nodes
- **Delegators** - Stake SKL tokens to support validators
- **Chain Owners** - Deploy and manage SKALE Chains
- **Developers** - Build applications on SKALE Chains

## Overview

A gasless transaction is a blockchain transaction native to SKALE Network that does not require the user to have any gas in their wallet to interact with the network. The steps of a gasless transaction are as follows:

1. Determine the **sender address**, the **sender address nonce**, and the **gas limit** of the transaction.
2. Use [Proof of Work](#exploring-proof-of-work) to generate a [magic number](#understanding-magic-numbers).
3. Build the transaction with the gasPrice of the transaction set to the value of the magic number
4. Execute the transaction, even without sFUEL in the sender's account

## Exploring Proof of Work

Proof of Work [on SKALE] is a method that allows wallets to *mine* sufficient amount of sFUEL to any address to send a transaction.
The act of mining is computationally expensive and requires a user to solve a complex mathematical problem to generate a magic number.
This computation cost is what makes it such a great deterrent from being used to spam the network since it would cost a bad actor a significant amount of money to do so.

## Understanding Magic Numbers

SKALE uses the concept of "the magic number" in conjunction with Proof of Work to allow the sender (i.e the client) and SKALE Chain to agree that a transaction is valid
EVEN IF there is not a sufficient amount of sFUEL (inclusive of 0 sFUEL) in the sender's account. This also allows gasless transactions to remain fully compatible with the
Ethereum Virtual Machine and most popular tools.

## Proof of Work Algorithm

1. The client generates a random 256-bit X (i.e the magic number) by a formula which is equal to a unique gasPrice value

<Latex>X = sha3(address) \oplus sha3(nonce) \oplus sha3(gasPrice)</Latex>

<Latex>freeGas = \frac{2^{256}-1}{X \cdot difficulty}</Latex>

2. Check whether X is allowed to run transaction

<Latex>freeGas(X) > estimateGas(tx)</Latex>

3. If false, then back to the first step
4. If true, then send the transaction with gasPrice = `X` and `gasLimit` = freeGas(X)

<Note>
- ⊕ is the bitwise XOR operator
- KECCAK256(SHA3) is the hashing algorithm that should be used
</Note>

<Warning>
MetaMask and other popular browser wallets with which SKALE Chains are compatible do not always support gasless transactions. This is
because the magic number generated is generally very, very large and the wallets either have a limitation on the number size or on the lack of gas in the user wallet.
</Warning>

## Popular Use Cases

### Invisible Transactions

Building using gasless transactions allows developers to create applications that have no "blockchain" that is visible to the user.
Creating seamless experiences that have no friction for new users is critical toward building applications that can be adopted globally and pass
the grandma test (yes, even grandma can use it)!

While invisible transactions can be done with [zero gas fees](/concepts/gas-fees/zero-gas-fees), gasless transactions can really help take your dApp to the next level.

### sFUEL Distribution

sFUEL Distribution is a process that allows developers to invisibly give users gas to interact with their dApp.
This process is critical to ensuring that users can interact with your dApp especially with the sFUEL token being unpurchasable.
While many developers choose to lean on servers to operate the distribution, using gasless transactions allows developers to lean on public faucet infrastructure or custom
distribution contracts that have no operational overhead. This can greatly reduce the costs of operating a dApp and greatly increase security for applications that may be popular targets
for bad actors.

### True Decentralization & Enhanced Security

With sFUEL on SKALE being metered by operators and developers to properly secure the chain from being spammed; the truest path towards decentralization of your application
is using gasless transactions. Switching or starting with the proof of work method means that you as a developer never have to worry about having "enough gas".

title: The SKL Token
description: A conceptual overview and introduction into the SKL Token
---

The SKL token is an ERC-777 hybrid utility token natively deployed to Ethereum that allows its holders to:

- Delegate SKL tokens to validators which are then staked into the delegated proof of stake SKALE Network
- Stake SKL tokens as a validator to run a SKALE Supernode
- Pay for SKALE Chains in accordance with SKALE Network's economic model
- Participate in SKALE Network governance via the SKALE DAO for those who are actively delegated to a validator

<Note>
SKL is NOT the native gas token of SKALE Chains. Unlike other chains where the native token holds economic value in order to pay for gas fees, SKALE Chains use a token with no economic value called sFUEL which enables zero-gas cost transactions.
</Note>

The SKL token is native to Ethereum, but available across multiple chains. The following are the official deployments: 

| Chain | Address | Notes |
| - | - | - |
| Ethereum | https://etherscan.io/address/0x00c83aeCC790e8a4453e5dD3B0B4b3680501a7A7 | This is the original deployed token |

## Governance

If you hold and delegate SKL tokens you can vote on governance proposals that affect the economic operations of the SKALE Network. This includes proposals for SKALE Chain pricing, network inflation, and more. See [the forum post introducing governance](https://forum.skale.network/t/a-proposal-for-skale-networks-on-chain-governance-system/447) for more.

When you vote on a proposal you use your SKL tokens to signal approval or opposition of the active proposal up for vote. The more SKL tokens you have, the more influence you can vote with.

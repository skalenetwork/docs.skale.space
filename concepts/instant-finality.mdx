## Overview

SKALE achieves instant finality for transactions, meaning transactions are confirmed immediately without waiting for multiple block confirmations. This is critical for applications requiring immediate state confirmation, especially for autonomous agents.

## Instant Finality

Unlike many blockchains that require multiple block confirmations, SKALE transactions achieve finality in a single block. Once a transaction is included in a block and the block is committed, the transaction is final and cannot be reverted.

## Benefits

- **Immediate confirmation** - Transactions are final as soon as they're included in a block
- **Agent-friendly** - Autonomous agents can make decisions immediately based on confirmed state
- **Real-time applications** - Enables real-time payment systems and interactive applications
- **Reduced latency** - No waiting for multiple confirmations

## How It Works

SKALE's consensus mechanism ensures that once a block is committed with a supermajority threshold signature, it is final. The BLS threshold signature provides cryptographic proof that the block has been agreed upon by the required majority of nodes.

## Use Cases

- **Payments** - Instant payment confirmation
- **Agent operations** - Agents can react immediately to state changes
- **Gaming** - Real-time game state updates
- **DeFi** - Immediate settlement of trades and swaps

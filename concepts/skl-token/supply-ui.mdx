## Features

The Supply UI provides:

- **Circulating Supply** - The amount of tokens currently circulating in the market and unlocked
- **Total Supply** - The amount of coins that have already been created, minus any coins that have been burned
- **Max Supply** - The maximum amount of tokens that can be created (7,000,000,000 SKL)
- **Percent Unlocked** - The percentage of total token supply currently in circulation
- **Monthly Distribution** - Token distribution by category for each month
- **Unlock Schedule** - Timeline of token unlocks and releases

## Key Metrics

### Circulating Supply
The amount of tokens that are circulating in the market and unlocked. This represents tokens available for trading and use.

### Total Supply
The amount of coins that have already been created, minus any coins that have been burned. This includes both circulating and locked tokens.

### Max Supply
The maximum amount of tokens that can be created (7,000,000,000 SKL). This is the hard cap for SKL token creation.

### Percent Unlocked
The percentage of total token supply currently in circulation. This metric helps understand the rate of token release.

## Monthly Distribution

The Supply UI shows token distribution by category for each month:

- **Unlocked this Month** - Tokens unlocked in the selected month
- **Unlocked Total** - Cumulative tokens unlocked up to that month
- **% of Current Total Supply** - Percentage of tokens created this month relative to total supply
- **% of Max Supply (7B)** - Percentage of tokens created this month relative to max supply

## Using the Supply UI

2. **View Categories** - See token distribution across different categories
3. **Track Unlocks** - Monitor token unlock schedules and releases
4. **Analyze Trends** - Understand token supply trends over time

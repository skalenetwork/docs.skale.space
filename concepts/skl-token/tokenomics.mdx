## Overview

The SKL token is an ERC-777 hybrid utility token with a maximum supply of 7,000,000,000 tokens. Understanding SKL tokenomics is essential for participants in the SKALE Network ecosystem.

## Token Details

- **Ticker**: SKL
- **Standard**: ERC-777
- **Max Supply**: 7,000,000,000 SKL
- **Network Issuance**: 9.3% (based on Total Supply at Genesis)
- **Initial Circulating Supply (Day 61)**: 564,166,667 SKL
- **Public Launch Allocation**: 175,000,000 SKL (4.23% of max supply)
- **Public Launch Price**: $0.03

## Token Distribution

SKL tokens are distributed across various categories:

- **Early Supporters** - Tokens allocated to early supporters with lock-up periods
- **Public Launch** - Tokens available at public launch
- **Network Issuance** - Tokens issued through network operations and staking rewards
- **Validator Rewards** - Tokens distributed to validators for securing the network
- **Delegator Rewards** - Tokens distributed to delegators for staking

## Early Supporter Allocations

Early supporters purchased the right to support the network via an agreement for future tokens upon network launch. Prices vary based on time of investment, with lower prices balanced with longer lock-periods:

### Round 1
- **Purchase Price**: $0.0034 per SKL
- **Total Lock Period**: 36 months (5+ years aggregate)

### Round 2
- **Purchase Price**: $0.0099 - $0.0125 per SKL
- **Total Lock Period**: 15 months (3+ years aggregate)

### Round 3
- **Purchase Price**: $0.0152 per SKL
- **Total Lock Period**: 15 months (2+ years aggregate)

## Token Lock-Up Schedule

All lock dates commence at Phase 2 Network Launch. Tokens awarded to SKALE supporters in early (pre-public) rounds are not liquid upon launch. To ensure network security and stability, these tokens can be staked. All staked tokens earn standard validator rewards.

## Token Unlock Schedule

The token unlock schedule is dynamic and can be tracked through the [SKL Supply UI](/concepts/skl-token/supply-ui). The schedule ensures gradual token release to maintain network stability.

## Token Use Cases

SKL tokens serve multiple purposes:

- **Staking** - Validators stake SKL to run nodes
- **Delegation** - Delegators delegate SKL to validators
- **Chain Payment** - Developers pay SKL to deploy and rent SKALE Chains
- **Governance** - SKL holders participate in SKALE DAO governance

## Network Economics

SKALE Network operates on a subscription-based model:

- **Chain Rental** - Developers pay SKL tokens to rent SKALE Chain resources
- **Staking Rewards** - Validators and delegators earn rewards for securing the network
- **Inflation** - Network inflation provides ongoing rewards for network participants

## Proof-of-Use Required Staking

The minimum required staking term on ConsenSys Activate platform is 60 days. At least 50% of tokens need to be staked in order for Proof of Use requirement to be satisfied.

## Staking Rewards

Staking rewards can be calculated using the rewards calculator. Rewards are distributed based on:

- **Staking Amount** - The amount of SKL staked
- **Staking Period** - The duration of the staking period
- **Validator Performance** - Validator uptime and participation
- **Network Participation** - Participation in network operations

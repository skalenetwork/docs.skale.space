## How Consensus Works

SKALE Chains run a leaderless, asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus. Validators propose blocks, broadcast data-availability proofs, and then vote in parallel. Once a supermajority (≥2/3) signs a proposal with BLS threshold signatures, the block is final—no reorgs or extra confirmations needed.

## Block Production Flow

1. Validators collect transactions, create proposals, and share transaction hashes.
2. Peers sign data-availability receipts to prove the proposal is widely distributed.
3. Asynchronous binary consensus selects the winning proposal.
4. Validators produce a threshold signature; the block becomes final and is executed in the EVM.

## Performance and Reliability

Because consensus is asynchronous, chains keep progressing even when the network is slow or partially partitioned. Instant finality and zero gas fees make SKALE ideal for real-time apps, games, and agent-driven workflows where users cannot wait for multiple confirmations.

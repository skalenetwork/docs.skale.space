## Overview

Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) provide hardware-based security for sensitive operations in the SKALE Network. TEEs enable secure computation in isolated environments that protect data and code from external access.

## What are TEEs?

TEEs are secure areas of a processor that provide:

- **Isolated execution** - Code runs in a protected environment
- **Data confidentiality** - Data is encrypted and protected
- **Integrity verification** - Code and data integrity can be verified
- **Remote attestation** - Proof that code is running in a genuine TEE

## TEEs in SKALE

SKALE utilizes TEEs for:

- **Key Management** - Secure storage and management of cryptographic keys
- **DKG Operations** - Secure distributed key generation for BLS signatures
- **Private Operations** - Secure execution of sensitive computations

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Security** - Hardware-level protection for critical operations
- **Key Protection** - Cryptographic keys are protected even from node operators
- **Trust Minimization** - Reduces trust requirements in validator operations
- **Compliance** - Enables compliance with security requirements

## Implementation

SKALE's TEE implementation uses:

- **SGX (Software Guard Extensions)** - Intel's TEE technology
- **Remote Attestation** - Verification of TEE authenticity
- **Secure Key Storage** - Keys stored and used within TEE boundaries

## Use Cases

- **Validator Operations** - Secure key management for validators
- **Enterprise Deployments** - Additional security for enterprise chains
- **Compliance** - Meeting regulatory requirements for data protection
- **Confidential Computing** - Secure computation of sensitive data

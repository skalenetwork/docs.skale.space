## Overview

MEV (Maximum Extractable Value) is profit from reordering, inserting, or censoring transactions. BITE Protocol attacks MEV at the source by hiding the data fields bots rely on until after finality.

## What is MEV?

MEV thrives on visibility:
- Arbitrage between venues
- Liquidations in lending markets
- Front-running and sandwich attacks on swaps
- Back-running profitable trades

## MEV on Traditional Blockchains

Public mempools give sophisticated actors a preview of pending trades. They bid up gas, reorder transactions, and capture value—raising costs and creating centralization pressure around specialized MEV infrastructure.

## MEV and BITE Protocol

BITE closes the visibility gap:
- **Confidential ordering** – Encrypt `to` and `data` so bots can’t target trades.
- **Commit-then-reveal** – Consensus finalizes first, then decrypts for execution.
- **Cross-chain trustlessness** – Keep confidentiality even when bridging or messaging.

## MEV Mitigation Strategies

- **Instant finality** – Shrinks the window for manipulation.
- **Zero gas fees** – Removes gas-price auctions as a lever.
- **Encrypted payloads** – No readable calldata means no sandwiching.
- **Fair ordering** – Leaderless consensus with DA proofs reduces proposer advantage.

## Impact on Users

MEV mitigation benefits users by:

- **Reduced Front-Running** - Users are less vulnerable to front-running attacks
- **Lower Costs** - Reduced MEV extraction means lower effective costs for users
- **Fairer Access** - More equitable access to transaction inclusion
- **Better Privacy** - Confidential transactions protect user information

## MEV in Cross-Chain Context

BITE Protocol's cross-chain capabilities introduce additional considerations:

- **Cross-Chain Arbitrage** - Opportunities for arbitrage across chains
- **Bridge MEV** - MEV extraction related to cross-chain bridges
- **Interoperability MEV** - MEV opportunities in multi-chain environments

BITE’s encrypted messaging reduces the surface area for cross-chain MEV by hiding intent until finality.

## Best Practices

When building on SKALE with BITE Protocol:

- **Use cApps** – Keep sensitive flows confidential by default.
- **Design for commit-then-reveal** – Sequence actions assuming hidden calldata.
- **Encrypt bridge interactions** – Maintain privacy across chains to limit MEV vectors.

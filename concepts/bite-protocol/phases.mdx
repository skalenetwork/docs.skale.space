## Overview

The BITE (Blockchain Interoperability and Trustless Execution) protocol has evolved through multiple phases, each building upon the previous to enable increasingly sophisticated cross-chain operations and confidential applications.

## BITE Protocol Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

The initial phase establishes the core infrastructure for cross-chain communication:

- **Message Passing** - Secure message transmission between chains
- **State Verification** - Cryptographic verification of cross-chain state
- **Basic Interoperability** - Connect SKALE Chains with Ethereum and other networks

### Phase 2: Trustless Execution

Building on the foundation, Phase 2 introduces trustless execution capabilities:

- **Cross-Chain Operations** - Execute operations across chains without trusted intermediaries
- **Execution Guarantees** - Cryptographic guarantees for cross-chain execution
- **Agent Support** - Enable agents to operate across multiple chains

### Phase 3: Confidential Applications

The current phase focuses on enabling confidential applications (cApps):

- **Privacy-Preserving Computation** - Execute computations on confidential data
- **Data Confidentiality** - Protect sensitive data while maintaining blockchain benefits
- **Enterprise Features** - Support for enterprise use cases requiring data privacy

## Current Capabilities

BITE Protocol currently enables:

- **Cross-Chain Agents** - Agents operating across multiple blockchain networks
- **Confidential AI** - AI applications that process sensitive data securely
- **Private Finance** - Financial applications with confidential transaction details
- **Healthcare Data** - Healthcare applications that protect patient privacy
- **Supply Chain Privacy** - Supply chain tracking with confidential business data

## Future Phases

Future phases will continue to expand BITE's capabilities:

- **Enhanced Privacy** - Advanced privacy-preserving techniques
- **Broader Interoperability** - Support for additional blockchain networks
- **Performance Optimization** - Improved throughput and latency
- **Developer Tools** - Enhanced tooling for building cApps

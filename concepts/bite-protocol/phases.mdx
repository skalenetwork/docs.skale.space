<Note>
**Deployment Status**
- **Phase 1: Encrypted Transactions** is live on SKALE Base Mainnet and Testnet
- **Phase 2: Conditional Transactions** is available in a Sandbox environment — contact the SKALE team at [https://discord.gg/skale](https://discord.gg/skale) for access
</Note>

BITE rolls out in four phases, keeping SKALE EVM-compatible while adding privacy and MEV resistance.

## Phase 1: Encrypted Transactions

Transactions are encrypted before entering the mempool, then decrypted by the validator committee after block finality. Transaction details remain hidden during mempool and consensus—preventing front-running and manipulation. Once executed, transactions are visible on-chain like any other.

## Phase 2: Conditional Transactions

Smart contracts can request decryption of specific encrypted data on-demand. Contract state remains confidential throughout its lifecycle, with selective disclosure only when needed for execution.

## Phase 3: Threshold Re-encryption

Data can be re-encrypted with new keys without decryption, enabling fine-grained access control and dynamic privacy settings without exposing the underlying data.

## Phase 4: Threshold Fully Homomorphic Encryption (THFE)

Computation on encrypted data becomes possible—smart contracts execute without revealing inputs or outputs, enabling privacy-preserving applications previously impossible on EVM chains.

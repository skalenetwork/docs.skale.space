## Overview

BITE rolls out in four phases, moving from encrypted transaction inclusion to fully homomorphic encrypted computation. Each step keeps SKALE EVM-compatible while dialing up privacy and MEV resistance.

## BITE Protocol Phases

### Phase 1: Threshold Decryption During Consensus

The first phase establishes threshold decryption capabilities during the consensus process:

- **Encrypted Transaction Inclusion** - Transactions are encrypted before entering the mempool
- **Threshold Decryption** - Validator committee collaborates to decrypt transactions after block finality
- **MEV Resistance** - Transaction details remain hidden until after consensus commitment
- **Commit-Then-Reveal** - Ensures transactions cannot be front-run or manipulated

### Phase 2: Threshold Decryption on Smart Contract Data

Building on Phase 1, Phase 2 extends threshold decryption to smart contract data:

- **Encrypted State** - Smart contract data can be stored in encrypted form
- **On-Demand Decryption** - Data is decrypted only when needed for execution
- **Enhanced Privacy** - Contract state remains confidential throughout its lifecycle
- **Confidential Applications (cApps)** - Enables applications that process sensitive data securely

### Phase 3: Threshold Re-encryption

Phase 3 introduces threshold re-encryption capabilities:

- **Key Rotation** - Ability to re-encrypt data with new keys without decryption
- **Access Control** - Fine-grained control over who can decrypt specific data
- **Dynamic Privacy** - Privacy settings can be adjusted without exposing data
- **Advanced Use Cases** - Supports more complex privacy-preserving applications

### Phase 4: Threshold Fully Homomorphic Encryption (THFE) Within Smart Contracts

The final phase enables computation on encrypted data:

- **Homomorphic Operations** - Perform computations directly on encrypted data
- **Zero-Knowledge Execution** - Execute smart contracts without revealing inputs or outputs
- **Maximum Privacy** - Data never needs to be decrypted for computation
- **Next-Generation Applications** - Enables previously impossible privacy-preserving use cases

## Current Status

BITE Protocol is actively being developed across these phases, with Phase 1 providing the foundation for MEV resistance and transaction privacy on SKALE.

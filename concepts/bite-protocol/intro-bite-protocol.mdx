## What Is Proof‑of‑Encryption?

Proof-of-Encryption (PoE) keeps SKALE transactions sealed from submission through finality. Data stays encrypted in flight, preventing front-running, snooping, or manipulation. Only after consensus does the validator committee decrypt for execution using threshold keys—no single party can peek or tamper early.

## How BITE Enables Proof‑of‑Encryption

BITE extends the EVM with threshold encryption so builders keep their existing Solidity, wallets, and tooling. Its goals:
- **Kill MEV at the root** by hiding calldata and destination until after finality.
- **Make privacy default** so Web2-grade apps can ship without revealing sensitive data.
- **Stay EVM-native** so Metamask, Foundry, Ethers, and Viem work as-is.

BITE rolls out in four phases—from encrypted transaction inclusion to fully homomorphic encryption inside contracts. See [Phases of BITE](/concepts/bite-protocol/phases) for the roadmap.

## Native MEV Resistance

By encrypting the `to` and `data` fields, BITE removes the information MEV bots need. Transactions are opaque until after finality, making front-running and sandwich attacks impossible.

How it works:
1. Wallet encrypts payload with SKALE’s threshold encryption (same tx format, no custom wallet needed).
2. Consensus finalizes the encrypted transaction.
3. Validators jointly decrypt after finality, then execute in the EVM.

## Two‑Phase Execution Model

1. Inclusion Phase – Encrypted transactions are verified and finalized onchain.
2. Execution Phase – After block finality, the validator committee runs threshold decryption and reveals the transaction for EVM execution.

Because inclusion happens before decryption, SKALE achieves commit‑then‑reveal semantics, preventing frontrunning and censorship at the protocol layer.

## Censorship Resistance

With BITE Protocol:

* The transaction to field is encrypted.
* Similar transactions (same gas/data patterns) cannot be easily correlated or censored.
* Routine activity becomes opaque to outside observers.

## Consensus And Key Management

* Threshold encryption is built directly into SKALE consensus.
* Fresh public/private keys are generated each epoch using an onchain Distributed Key Generation (DKG) protocol.
* A new random committee is selected each epoch for encryption and decryption duties.
* SKALE combines DKG, threshold BLS signatures, and encrypted mempool‑less execution.

This rotating, onchain-managed key system keeps trust decentralized while enabling privacy-by-default.

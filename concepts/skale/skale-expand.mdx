description: Bringing Private Execution, Instant Finality, and Infinite Scalability to any Blockchain

For over five (5) years, SKALE has often been confused as both a Layer 1 and a Layer 2. SKALE Expand leans into the truth of what SKALE is -- an application capable of launching many blockchains into the form of a network and embodies the technical growth that SKALE is capable of; bringing private and scalable blockchain compute to every ecosystem, ushering in the growth and adoption of artificial intelligence agentic commerce. [SKALE on Base](/get-started/quick-start/skale-on-base) is the first SKALE Expand network.

## SKALE Expand

### About the Network Deployments

- The base component of SKALE Network on Ethereum is SKALE Manager
- SKALE Expand creates new deployments of SKALE Manager on a new EVM Chain (can be expanded to non-EVM)
- New deployments have 100% separate pools of compute
- The truly canonical deployment of SKL remains on Ethereum Mainnet. All subsequent deployments of SKL are bridged and are not able to create new SKL tokens without being locked on Ethereum.
- New deployments can have bespoke features that are not available on other deployments
- sChains created on a specific deployment do not impact the resources of another deployment

### About the SKALE Chains
- Each SKALE Chain (sChain) is a Layer 1 blockchain
- sChains are *NOT* rollups and do not push state or checkpoints back to the parent chain (regardless of Layer)
- sChains can be application-specific blockchains for a single entity, shared chains for a group of entities, or fully permissionless blockchains allowing anyone to consume the resources
- sChains can now be created off of any blockchain network that has a SKALE Manager deployment

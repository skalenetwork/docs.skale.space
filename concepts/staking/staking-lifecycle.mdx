## Overview

The SKL staking lifecycle describes the complete process from proposing a delegation to unbonding tokens. Understanding this lifecycle is essential for both validators and delegators participating in the SKALE Network.

## Staking Lifecycle Stages

The SKL staking lifecycle consists of five main stages:

1. **Propose Delegation** - Delegator proposes delegation to a validator
2. **Accepted** - Validator accepts the delegation
3. **Staked** - Tokens are staked and earning rewards
4. **Undelegation Request** - Delegator requests to undelegate
5. **Unbonded** - Tokens are unbonded and can be withdrawn

## Stage 1: Propose Delegation

### What Happens

- **Delegator Action** - Delegator initiates delegation proposal
- **Validator Selection** - Delegator selects a validator
- **Amount Specification** - Delegator specifies amount to delegate
- **Period Selection** - Delegator selects staking period
- **Proposal Submission** - Delegation proposal is submitted

### Requirements

- **SKL Tokens** - Delegator must have SKL tokens
- **Validator Availability** - Validator must be accepting delegations
- **Minimum Amount** - Meet minimum delegation amount
- **Valid Period** - Select valid staking period

## Stage 2: Accepted

### What Happens

- **Validator Review** - Validator reviews delegation proposal
- **Acceptance** - Validator accepts the delegation
- **Contract Update** - Delegation contract is updated
- **Status Change** - Delegation status changes to accepted

### Validator Considerations

- **Capacity** - Validator must have capacity for delegation
- **Performance** - Validator performance affects acceptance
- **Terms** - Validator may have specific terms
- **Network Status** - Network status affects acceptance

## Stage 3: Staked

### What Happens

- **Token Locking** - SKL tokens are locked
- **Staking Active** - Staking becomes active
- **Reward Earning** - Delegator starts earning rewards
- **Network Participation** - Tokens contribute to network security

### During Staking

- **Rewards** - Delegator earns rewards based on staking amount and period
- **Lock Period** - Tokens remain locked during staking period
- **Validator Performance** - Rewards depend on validator performance
- **Network Operations** - Tokens participate in network operations

### Rewards

Rewards are distributed based on:

- **Staking Amount** - Amount of SKL staked
- **Staking Period** - Duration of staking period
- **Validator Performance** - Validator uptime and participation
- **Network Participation** - Participation in network operations

## Stage 4: Undelegation Request

### What Happens

- **Delegator Request** - Delegator requests to undelegate
- **Request Submission** - Undelegation request is submitted
- **Unbonding Period** - Unbonding period begins
- **Status Change** - Delegation status changes to unbonding

### Unbonding Period

- **Duration** - Unbonding period has specific duration
- **No Rewards** - Rewards stop during unbonding period
- **Token Lock** - Tokens remain locked during unbonding
- **Completion** - Unbonding completes after period

### Considerations

- **Timing** - Consider timing of undelegation request
- **Rewards** - Rewards stop during unbonding
- **Lock Period** - Tokens remain locked during unbonding
- **Network Impact** - Consider impact on network security

## Stage 5: Unbonded

### What Happens

- **Unbonding Complete** - Unbonding period completes
- **Token Release** - Tokens are released from staking
- **Withdrawal Available** - Tokens can be withdrawn
- **Status Change** - Delegation status changes to unbonded

### After Unbonding

- **Token Access** - Delegator can access tokens
- **Withdrawal** - Tokens can be withdrawn
- **Re-staking** - Tokens can be re-staked if desired
- **Freedom** - Tokens are no longer locked

## Lifecycle Considerations

### For Delegators

- **Staking Period** - Choose appropriate staking period
- **Validator Selection** - Select reliable validators
- **Rewards** - Understand reward structure
- **Risks** - Be aware of slashing and unbonding risks

### For Validators

- **Delegation Management** - Manage delegations effectively
- **Performance** - Maintain high performance
- **Capacity** - Manage delegation capacity
- **Rewards** - Distribute rewards fairly

## Best Practices

### Delegators

- **Research Validators** - Research validators before delegating
- **Diversify** - Consider diversifying across validators
- **Monitor Performance** - Monitor validator performance
- **Understand Terms** - Understand staking terms and conditions

### Validators

- **Maintain Uptime** - Maintain high uptime
- **Fair Distribution** - Distribute rewards fairly
- **Transparency** - Be transparent about operations
- **Communication** - Communicate with delegators

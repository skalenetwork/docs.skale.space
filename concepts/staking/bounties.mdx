## Overview

Bounties are rewards distributed to validators for securing the SKALE Network. Bounties are distributed monthly based on validator performance and participation in network operations.

## What are Bounties?

Bounties are:

- **Monthly Rewards** - Distributed monthly to validators
- **Performance-Based** - Based on validator performance
- **Network Security** - Rewards for securing the network
- **Validator Incentive** - Incentive for validators to maintain high performance

## How Bounties Work

### Distribution

Bounties are distributed through:

- **BountyV2 Contract** - Managed by BountyV2 contract in SKALE Manager
- **Monthly Distribution** - Distributed monthly
- **Performance Calculation** - Calculated based on validator performance
- **Automatic Distribution** - Automatically distributed to validators

### Performance Metrics

Bounty distribution considers:

- **Uptime** - Validator uptime and availability
- **Chain Participation** - Participation in chain operations
- **Block Production** - Block production and validation
- **Network Operations** - Participation in network operations

## Bounty Calculation

### Factors

Bounties are calculated based on:

- **Staking Amount** - Amount of SKL staked
- **Performance** - Validator performance metrics
- **Chain Participation** - Participation in chain operations
- **Network Contribution** - Contribution to network security

### Distribution

Bounties are distributed:

- **Monthly** - Distributed monthly
- **Proportional** - Proportional to staking and performance
- **Automatic** - Automatically distributed
- **Transparent** - Transparent distribution process

## Validator Requirements

To earn bounties, validators must:

- **Stake SKL** - Stake minimum amount of SKL
- **Run Nodes** - Operate SKALE nodes
- **Maintain Uptime** - Maintain high uptime
- **Participate** - Participate in network operations

## Delegator Benefits

Delegators benefit from bounties through:

- **Reward Sharing** - Share in validator bounty rewards
- **Performance Incentive** - Validators incentivized to perform well
- **Network Security** - Network security benefits all participants
- **Return on Staking** - Return on staked SKL tokens

## Bounty vs Other Rewards

### Bounties

- **Monthly Distribution** - Distributed monthly
- **Performance-Based** - Based on validator performance
- **Network Security** - Rewards for network security
- **Validator Focus** - Focused on validator rewards

### Staking Rewards

- **Continuous** - Earned continuously during staking
- **Amount-Based** - Based on staking amount
- **Period-Based** - Based on staking period
- **Delegator Focus** - Focused on delegator rewards

## Best Practices

### For Validators

- **Maintain Uptime** - Maintain high uptime for maximum bounties
- **Participate Actively** - Actively participate in network operations
- **Monitor Performance** - Monitor performance metrics
- **Optimize Operations** - Optimize node operations

### For Delegators

- **Choose Performers** - Choose validators with good performance
- **Monitor Validators** - Monitor validator performance
- **Understand Rewards** - Understand how bounties affect rewards
- **Diversify** - Consider diversifying across validators

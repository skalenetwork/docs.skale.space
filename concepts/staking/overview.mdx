## Overview

Staking is the process of locking SKL tokens to participate in securing the SKALE Network. Stakers can either run validator nodes or delegate their tokens to validators.

## Staking Options

- **Validator Staking** - Run a validator node and stake SKL tokens directly
- **Delegation** - Delegate SKL tokens to existing validators

## Benefits

- Earn rewards for securing the network
- Participate in network governance
- Support the SKALE ecosystem

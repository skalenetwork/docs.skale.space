## Overview

Staking SKL tokens allows you to participate in securing the SKALE Network and earn rewards. This guide covers the basics of staking and delegation on SKALE.

<Warning>
**Important**: Staking is currently available **ONLY on Ethereum Mainnet**. All staking operations must be performed on Ethereum Mainnet, not on SKALE Chains.
</Warning>

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Set Up a Wallet

You'll need a Web3 wallet that supports Ethereum Mainnet:

- **MetaMask** - Most popular Web3 wallet
- **WalletConnect** - Connect with mobile wallets
- **Hardware Wallets** - Ledger, Trezor for enhanced security

### Step 2: Acquire SKL Tokens

You need SKL tokens to stake:

- **Purchase SKL** - Buy SKL tokens from exchanges
- **Bridge SKL** - Bridge SKL from SKALE Chains to Ethereum Mainnet if needed
- **Ensure Balance** - Ensure you have enough SKL for staking

### Step 3: Choose Staking Method

You have two options:

#### Option A: Delegate to a Validator

- **No Technical Setup** - No need to run nodes
- **Lower Barrier** - Lower barrier to entry
- **Earn Rewards** - Earn rewards from validator performance
- **Flexible** - Can choose validator and staking period

#### Option B: Become a Validator

- **Run Nodes** - Operate SKALE nodes
- **Higher Rewards** - Potentially higher rewards
- **Technical Requirements** - Requires technical expertise
- **Network Contribution** - Direct contribution to network security

## Staking Portal

The easiest way to stake is through the **SKALE Portal**:

**[Stake on SKALE Portal →](https://portal.skale.space/staking)**

The portal provides:

- **Easy Interface** - User-friendly staking interface
- **Validator Selection** - Browse and select validators
- **Staking Management** - Manage your staking positions
- **Reward Tracking** - Track your staking rewards

## Delegation Process

### 1. Connect Wallet

- Connect your Web3 wallet to the SKALE Portal
- Ensure you're connected to **Ethereum Mainnet**
- Verify your SKL token balance

### 2. Select Validator

- Browse available validators
- Review validator performance metrics
- Consider validator commission rates
- Select a validator

### 3. Choose Staking Period

- Select staking period (affects rewards)
- Longer periods typically offer higher rewards
- Consider your liquidity needs

### 4. Delegate Tokens

- Enter amount to delegate
- Review delegation details
- Confirm transaction on Ethereum Mainnet
- Wait for confirmation

### 5. Monitor Staking

- Monitor your staking position
- Track rewards earned
- Check validator performance
- Manage your delegation

## Staking Lifecycle

Understanding the staking lifecycle:

1. **Propose Delegation** - Submit delegation proposal
2. **Accepted** - Validator accepts delegation
3. **Staked** - Tokens are staked and earning rewards
4. **Undelegation Request** - Request to undelegate
5. **Unbonded** - Tokens are unbonded and can be withdrawn

For detailed information, see [Staking Lifecycle](/concepts/staking/staking-lifecycle).

## Important Considerations

### Ethereum Mainnet Only

- All staking operations occur on **Ethereum Mainnet**
- SKL tokens must be on Ethereum Mainnet
- Gas fees are paid in ETH, not SKL

### Staking Periods

- Different staking periods offer different rewards
- Longer periods typically offer higher rewards
- Consider your liquidity needs when selecting period

### Validator Selection

- Choose validators with good performance
- Consider validator commission rates
- Monitor validator uptime and reliability

### Risks

- **Slashing Risk** - Validators can be slashed for misbehavior
- **Unbonding Period** - Tokens are locked during unbonding
- **Validator Risk** - Validator performance affects rewards

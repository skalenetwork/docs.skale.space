# SKALE Watchdog

SKALE Watchdog is microservice running on every SKALE supernode for providing SLA agents with supernode
performance metrics. It also can be used for external monitoring goals (validators can use it in
their monitoring tools).

## How It Works
Watchdog is a Python script running in docker container with Flask web server that provides simple
REST JSON API available on port 3009 (http://YOUR_SKALE_NODE_IP:3009). Currently, Watchdog can give
data on all SKALE supernode docker containers, health checks of sChains and SGX server, Ethereum node endpoint
status, and hardware information.

::::note
Node CLI automatically opens port 3009 on the machine using iptables.
Be sure that port 3009 is open for the supernode's external network for Watchdog to work.

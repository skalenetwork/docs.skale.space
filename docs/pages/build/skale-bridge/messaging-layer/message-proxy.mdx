title: Message Proxy
description: Using SKALE MessageProxy to connect blockchains
---


A message proxy within the SKALE Ecosystem is a key "connection" point that works to send and receive messages between Ethereum and SKALE Chains.
**MessageProxy** is an abstract smart contract that is extended into two key smart contracts used as cornerstones of the SKALE IMA Messaging Layer:

1. **MessageProxyForMainnet** -- the MessageProxy deployed on the Ethereum Mainnet with an architecture designed for posting messages to SKALE Chains
2. **MessageProxyForSchain** -- the MessageProxy that is pre-deployed on every SKALE Chain that enables communication with Ethereum Mainnet AND communication SKALE Chain to SKALE Chain

> MessageProxy is used to send messages to any contracts. It is used within the bridging layer to actually prepare and execute messages for transportation between chains.

## Architecture

- MessageProxy contracts are deployed on Mainnet, MessageProxyForMainnet, and each SKALE Chain, MessageProxyForSchain.
- Contracts must be registered to a MessageProxy which allows them to interact with IMA Agent
- Messages sent via MessageProxy are processed by the [IMA Agent](#ima-agent).
- Messages received via MessageProxy are forwarded to the target contract and executed

::::note
MessageProxyForSchain is deployed to **0xd2AAa00100000000000000000000000000000000** on EVERY SKALE Chain.


## Basic Implementation

Utilize the following base flow to send a message:

```solidity
interface IMessageProxy {
	function postOutgoingMessage(
		bytes32 targetChainHash,
		address targetContract,
		bytes calldata data
	) external;
}

contract ExampleSendContract {
	
	IMessageProxy private messageProxy = IMessageProxy(0xd2AAa00100000000000000000000000000000000); // Use this address for sChain, otherwise use the proper Mainnet Address

	function sendMessageToMainnet(address targetContract, bytes calldata data) external {
		messageProxy.postOutgoingMessage(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("Mainnet")), targetContract, data);
	}
}
```

Utilize the following base flow to receive a message:

```solidity
contract ExampleReceiveContract {

	function postMessage(
    	bytes32 schainHash,
    	address sender,
    	bytes calldata data
    )
    	external
    	returns (address)
	{
    	[add in your processing logic]
	}
}
```
::::note
Reminder to register the contracts and ensure if going SKALE Chain to SKALE Chain that the chains are connected first.



## IMA Agent

The IMA Agent is a service that runs within each SKALE Supernode that handles watching for transactions that are executed via MessageProxy* and processes them as messages accordingly.
The agent automatically utilizes the nodes trusted execution environment (TEE) through Intel SGX&copy; to handle the processing of messages.

## Managing IMA

IMA, similar to other predeployed contracts running on SKALE, is a highly customizable and managed by the SKALE Chain Owner/Operator or accounts delegated to them.
The following are managed by the SKALE Chain Owner:

### Message Size Limit

The default message size limit is 1,000,000 gas units. This limit can be changed on each individual SKALE Chain with the following process:

1. Assign `CONSTANT_SETTER_ROLE`, an OpenZeppelin-based smart contract role, to one of your multisignature wallets or trusted delegated accounts. This call
can be made by the [SKALE Chain Owner](/skale-chain/run-a-skale-chain/using-safe) or directly if another account is able to assign this role to your contract.



```shell title="MultisigWallet CLI"
npx msig encodeData schain-name-here MessageProxyForSchain grantRole 0x96e3fc3be15159903e053027cff8a23f39a990e0194abcd8ac1cf1b355b8b93c [0x-wallet-address-of-executor]
```

```ts title="Ethers v6 Example"
/**
* Run:
* npm install ethers dotenv
*/

import { Contract, JsonRpcProvider, Wallet } from "ethers";
import dotenv from "dotenv";
dotenv.config();

const MSG_PROXY_SCHAIN_ADDR = "0xd2AAa00100000000000000000000000000000000";
const MSG_PROXY_SCHAIN_ABI = [
	"function grantRole(bytes32 role, address account) external",
	"function setNewGasLimit(uint256 newGasLimit) external"
];

const provider = new JsonRpcProvider(process.env.RPC_URL);
const wallet = new Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, provider);
const contract = new Contract(MSG_PROXY_SCHAIN_ADDR, MSG_PROXY_SCHAIN_ABI, wallet);

const res = await contract.grantRole("0x96e3fc3be15159903e053027cff8a23f39a990e0194abcd8ac1cf1b355b8b93c", "0x[ACCOUNT_TO_GRANT_ROLE]");
```



2. Once assigned, use your account to set the new gas limit. 



```shell title="MultisigWallet CLI"
npx msig encodeData schain-name-here MessageProxyForSchain setNewGasLimit 3000000
```

```ts title="Ethers v6 Example"
/**
* Run:
* npm install ethers dotenv
*/

import { Contract, JsonRpcProvider, Wallet } from "ethers";
import dotenv from "dotenv";
dotenv.config();

const MSG_PROXY_SCHAIN_ADDR = "0xd2AAa00100000000000000000000000000000000";
const MSG_PROXY_SCHAIN_ABI = [
	"function grantRole(bytes32 role, address account) external",
	"function setNewGasLimit(uint256 newGasLimit) external"
];

const provider = new JsonRpcProvider(process.env.RPC_URL);
const wallet = new Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, provider);
const contract = new Contract(MSG_PROXY_SCHAIN_ADDR, MSG_PROXY_SCHAIN_ABI, wallet);

const res = await contract.setNewGasLimit(3000000); // Set to 3,000,000
```

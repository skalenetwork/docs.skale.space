# Block Rotation

Block rotation on a SKALE Chain limits the disk space used by consensus and full-sync nodes by pruning old blocks, ensuring efficient storage and performance.

## Storage Allocation

Each SKALE Chain reserves **12.6 GB** of storage for core blockchain data on consensus and full-sync nodes. This includes:

- `blocks`
- `transactions` and their receipts
- `log blooms` (for efficient event filtering)
- `"best"` — latest block info (`lastBlockHash`)
- `"chainStart"` — earliest available block (`firstBlockHash`, useful after importing snapshots)

<Aside type="note" title="Developer Note">
Block rotation does not apply to <strong>SKALE Archive Nodes</strong>or <strong>SKALE Indexer Nodes</strong>, which both store the full block history.
</Aside>

## How Block Rotation Works

To stay within the 12.6 GB limit, SKALE Chains maintain a dynamic range of block data:

- Only the **most recent 80–100%** of data is retained.
- The **oldest 20%** is pruned as new blocks are added.
- The rotation is based on **data size**, not block count.

### Example

If block storage nears the 12.6 GB cap:

- The chain deletes the oldest blocks until usage returns to ~80% of the cap.
- Only recent blocks remain accessible on consensus and full-sync nodes.

This sliding-window model ensures that the chain operates efficiently without growing indefinitely in size.

## Benefits

- **Efficient resource use** — prevents storage bloat.
- **High performance** — reduces read/write overhead.
- **Scalability** — supports many lightweight SKALE Chains running in parallel.

## Full Historical Access

If your app or service requires the entire blockchain history (e.g. for analytics, block explorers, or archival indexing), use a **SKALE Archive Node**, which:

- Stores all past blocks
- Maintains full transaction and log history
- Is not affected by block rotation

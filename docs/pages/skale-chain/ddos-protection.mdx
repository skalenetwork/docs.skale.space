# DDoS Protection

Besides limiting the gas consumption rate on SKALE Chains, each chain also comes
with a configurable DDOS protection system that allows the Chain to detect peak
(per second) and long load (per minute) JSON-RPC calls and WS/WSS connections.
The protection enables the chain to survive in high load situations by banning
caller origins for a preset number of seconds.

An example configuration is:

```json
"unddos": {
    "origins": [
        {
            "origin": [ "192.168.1.1", "127.0.0.*", "::1" ],
            "ban_lengthy": 0,
            "ban_peak": 0,
            "max_calls_per_minute": 1000000000,
            "max_calls_per_second": 1000000000,
            "max_ws_conn": 65535
        },
        {
            "origin": [ "*" ],
            "ban_lengthy": 120,
            "ban_peak": 15,
            "max_calls_per_minute": 5000,
            "max_calls_per_second": 1500,
            "max_ws_conn": 20
        }
    ]
}
```

The first "origins" block configures allowed unlimited load from specified IP origins.
The second origins block configures all call origins allowed, but allow 1500 JSON-RPC
calls per second and 5000 calls per minute. If the calls exceed the per second limit,
"ban_peak" bans the caller for 15 seconds. If the calls exceed the per minute limit,
"ban_lengthy" bans the caller for 120 seconds. And finally, "max_ws_conn" allows for
20 concurrent connections from a single IP.

The configuration settings can be expanded to limit specific JSON-RPC calls, like
eth_blockNumber. For example:

```json
{
	"origins": [
		{
			"ban_lengthy": 120,
			"ban_peak": 15,
			"custom_method_settings": {
				"eth_blockNumber": {
					"max_calls_per_minute": 150000,
					"max_calls_per_second": 5000
				}
			},
			"max_calls_per_minute": 15000,
			"max_calls_per_second": 500,
			"max_ws_conn": 50,
			"origin": ["*"]
		}
	]
}
```

And DDoS protection can be completely disabled with the following config:

```json
"unddos": {
    "enabled": false,
}
```

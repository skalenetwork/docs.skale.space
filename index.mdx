> The blockchain for billions of agents. SKALE is a network of Layer 1 blockchains offering infinite scalability, zero gas fees, and one of the fastest EVMs in the world.

SKALE enables developers to build applications that can scale to billions of users and agents. With zero gas fees, instant finality, and full EVM compatibility, SKALE is purpose-built for the next generation of decentralized applications, autonomous agents, and enterprise solutions.

### **Why SKALE?**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Purpose Built for Agents">
    SKALE is designed from the ground up to support billions of autonomous agents. With instant finality, zero gas fees, and siloed compute environments, agents can operate efficiently at scale without the constraints of traditional blockchain networks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Zero Gas Fees">
    SKALE offers zero gas fees for transactions, making it economically viable for agents to perform millions of operations. This enables new use cases that were previously impossible due to gas cost constraints.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Instant Finality">
    Transactions on SKALE achieve instant finality, critical for agent operations that require immediate state confirmation. This enables real-time decision making and coordination between agents.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Siloed Compute">
    SKALE Chains provide isolated compute environments perfect for enterprise and government use cases. Each chain operates independently while maintaining connection to the broader SKALE Network and public blockchains.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="EVM Compatibility">
    SKALE is fully EVM compatible. Developers can deploy contracts using the same tools and workflows they already know, including Foundry, Hardhat, and wallets like MetaMask. All major EVM infrastructure and libraries are supported out of the box.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="BITE Protocol">
    SKALE includes the BITE (Blockchain Interoperability and Trustless Execution) protocol, enabling secure cross-chain communication and trustless execution across different blockchain networks.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Use Cases

Confidential compute unlocks a wide range of applications that struggle to operate on traditional blockchains due to lack of privacy at the transaction level or due to lack of confidentiality in data processing and storage. This opens the door for innovative use cases across various industries including: artificial intelligence, consumer applications, finance, healthcare, and supply chain management.
